His voice became trumpet filled with wild whirlpools, deafening the ear with crashes of power, and yet intermingled all the while with sweet under song of the softest cadence.

 His face glowed like heated furnace while his countenancc was haggard as that of maniac, and ever and anon he flung his long, bony hands on high, as if grasping after thunder bolts.

 He drew picture of murder in such appalling colors, that in comparison hell might be considered beautiful place.

 He painted the slanderer so black the sun seemed dark at noon-day. when shining on such an accursed monster :. and then fixing both portraits on the shrinking man, closed by a strange ex- hortation to the jury, and the bystand- CTS.

 He advised the panel, after they should bring in verdict for the plain tiff, not to deal harshly with the de- fendant, however richly he deserved it; in other words not to 'lynch the villian,"" but leave his punishment with God""

 This was undoubtedly the most artful trick of all, and best calculated to in sure vengeance.

 The jury returned verdict of fifty thousand dollars, and the night after wards Hopkins was dragged from his bed by lynchcrs, and beaten almost to death.

|, A Baltimore correspondent Of the Boston
Journal, who has just returned from long
trip through the Southern States, makes the
following rather cheerful statement;


""Thirteen hundred and thirty miles of
cotton and corni That is what the traveller
from New Orleans to Baltimore, by railroad,
will see, and 1t is what your correspondent
saw in the ninety-two hours occupied in
that journey. Very doleful accounts of the
failure of the cotton crop had reached him
during the last few weeks in New Orleans
Between the laziness of the negroes, the
activity of the corn worm and the freaks of
of the clerk OF the weather, the cotton crop
was said to be in a bad way, and the man
who estimated for crop Of two millions of
bales was set down as an enthusiast. But
from New Orleans to Knoxville, distance
of seven hundred and sixty-two miles, saw
nothing but corn and cotton, and scarcely
know whether there was more cotton than
corn or more corn than cotton. All day
long, at the rate of twenty miles an hour,
we passed plantations covered with these two
produces. The cotton was for the most part
| in blossoms. Although the plant is general
ly low, it is vigorous and healthy. have
never seen better cotton than this, nor any
which promised a more productive yield.
In Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Ten
nessee l saw this belt of cotton land, and
from the travellers with whom conversed
learned that throughout the length and
width of shese States might have seen the
same picture. know that the bottom lands
along the Mississippi and Red Rivers have
been 80 devastated by floods that they can
not produce more than half their usual crop
this year. But throughout all the other por'
tions of these States / can see or hear moth
ing that in any way substantiates the dole
full stories thnt have been so persistently told
for the last few weeks. onthe contrary, saw
and heard much that convinced me that the
people had gone to work with good will,
and that Heaven had blessed their efforts.
There Is corn enough growing in these four
States to last for three years, and cotton
enough to give the people money for the
supply of all their other wants. The corn
lH IN mhBuluCtuL COuuitiouf hlObt VI Az 40 AAPSi
and all of 1t is out of danger. The country
in that portion of Mississippi, Alabama and
Tennessee through which passed is very
good, and parts of 1t are beautiful The
''rayages of war"" have nearly all disappear
ed. The names of the places through which
the road passes are now historical, and they
recall the memory Of the war; but there il
little else to remind one of the great revolu
ton. It seems to me that the people o
these States have accepted the situation sui
ficently at least TO induce them to go to worl
and make money; and while saw endles
indications of prosperity, saw none what
eyer of poverty or want.


tin Virginia, from Bristol to Lynchburg
saw more vacant and idle land than I say
in all the other States, and the corn crop


which was almost the only one growing, wa
poor, sickly and backward. Virginia fat
mers are further behind the times than thei
agricultural brethren of the States furthe
south. The great source of wealth in Wiz
ginia before the war was the breeding c


negroes. This particular branch OF indus


try is, of course, now at an end; and th
farmers with that peculiar slowness tha


charapterizes Yirginiaps, have not got fairl
started in the new paths they must henc'

Gorham organs gave glowing accounts of his
reception in SHASTA stating that he had an
audience of over thousand people, that be
was metaphoricaliy borne on the shoulders
of the admiring masses. and that the enthu-
slasm over him unbOunded. Of course,
everybody knew this to be bald ialSehood.
for the whole county Of Shasta hardly boasts
as many voters as there were people reported
to be rushing to do hOnors to Gorham. We
learn from gentleman-a staunch Republl-
can-who was present at the meeting that
the whole number in attendance when the
Boys cand late for Governor began to speak
less than 100 and that his audience
dwindled down to 20, all told, before he got
through. lle informs US. moreover, that his
scurrilous allusons t. the Evening Bulletin,
Sacramento Union and Morning Call were
received with such complimentary responses
as THAT is lie, - - The independent Press
tells the truth about you"" etc., etc. Cor
mind. and our informant says the number
of his hackers are growing small by
degrees and beautifully less"" daily.


Of kindred character with the accounts
of the - Great Demonstration"" in Shasta are
the telegraphic dispatches which are pub
lished in the Gorham papers. They are
manufactured to order.


The Union and Bulletin have very nice ar
rangement with each other, slys the Appeal.
The Union copies all the Bulletins falsehoods
regarding Gorham, and the Bulletin recipro-
Gates by copying all the Unions articles As
amatter Of course the Union copies the above
with gusto


The Gorham organs-as the Bulle
:, bo 6 o.


have not given glowing accounts of his re
ception in Shasta for the simple reason, that
he has not been within a hundred miles
of that place during the present canvass
He spoke at Chico last Saturday evening,
and that is the nearest place to Shasta he
has been at since he received the nomination
for Governor. In view Of this stateMent.
we ask our readers, to .peruse the above
article and then answer if they have ever
seen or heard of such cool impudence or
total disregard of truth in the annals of
journalism. The Bulletin and Union ex.
change with nearly all other papers in the
State, and yet, they have the impudence to
say that the papers friendly to the election
of Mr. Gorham, stated be had an audience
Of over a thousand people; that he was
metapborically borne on the shoulders of the
admring Masses and that the enthusiasm
over him was unbounded, when they know
very well that there is not Q Union paper in
the State that had anything of the kind, for
the simple reason as has already been stated.
that Mr. Gorham was not within hundred
miles Of the place. Then how knowing the
Bulletin is when it says, of course every.
body knew this to be fasehood."" When
that paper sets up man Of straw, it is very
easy for it to knock him down again. Then
it learned from staunch Republican""
who was present that his audience dwindled
down to 20, all told, lefore he got through
Is not that beautiful. They need net have
any brass foundries at San Francisco az

This shows how the Union and Bulletin gets
letters from . staunch Republican"" in
which pretended accounts are given of the
dissatisfaction with the Union ticket in diff
ferent parts Of the State. It isan easy thing
for one Of the editors Of the Bulletin or
Union, t1 set down in their sanetums and

or = Shirt-tal Canon, stating that Gorham
would not get vote in either of these en-

What the proprietors OF the papers get is

Christian was wiling to furnish the colored official with com fortable accommodations, but refused to put him in the company of and on an equality with his white passengers in the state room and at the table. The refusal caused the captain to be ordered before the doughty retainer of Philip D Orleans. When there, he demonstrated against the injury carry ing out the order would cause him. but the remonstrance was followed by i.av- ing guard sent on board to post up the order on the boat, and see that its provisions were complied with.

yesterday morning the prize fighting fraternity,
the curious, both white and colorod, and about
a dozen newspaper representatives, were making
active preparations to go across the river and
witness two prize hghts-oue between Rsshe
Bolster and new candidate for pugilistic honors

candidates for p. II. fame, the latter q native of
the Fourth ward, and tho other man who has
been alternating between this city and Dalti.
more.


Large crowds were copgregated at the inter.
section Of Pennsylvania avenue and Sixth street
west, at John O'Brian's Cottage restaurant, on
-Four and half street, Island, and at the corner
Of Thirteenth and G streets. Many OF the shOul.
der.hittcrs became pretty merry before starting,
and, about three a. m, two hackmen, who had
stopped ut the corner Of Thirteenth and Cstreots,
agreed to hgbt, right there, for the sum Of four
dollars. At 1t they won't, and four rattlng rounds
were fought in good time, when ono Of the men
was knocked out Of time, and tho other was de.
clsred winner. and pockcted the stakea.


Among those who werc present, with view
to going on the ""pic.nic,"" +"" were John Charles q
gay and lively sport, who keeps the Clipper
Shades on West Fayette street, Baltimore; also
Jim Henrietta and John Mulley Of tho same
city, as we'll as Andrew Arthur Mel. Kurtz,
Mike DOran, and others, from the city of Broth.
erly Love.


At about six o'clock all manner and styles of
vehicles were on their way from tho city to Fort
Albany, about two miles from tho city on the
Leesburg road, where the fight was expected to
take place. This fort Is situated only few rods
away fron the Rural House, kept by one Major
Burn, formerly of the second New York artil.
lery. A couple Of ""spats"" occurred on the way
out, between some Of the shoulder.hittors, but
no serious damage was done any one. On ar.
riving at the grounds Of the Of the expected
prize fights, q large crowd was found already on
hand. and the Majors whisky was doing Its
work briskly


Rumors soon commenced to foa. around that
Bowie, the colored man pitted against Sorrell,
had been brought to Major Burns house on the
previous evening by his trainer, was put to bed
with Anthony simms, and that at about mid.
night he got up and ran away, giving as a
reason therefor that his friends had advised him
to do so, as he had not been properly trained,
that vitriol had been applied to his hands to
damage them, end that thoy intended to beat
him foully II they could not do 1t fairly. 1t was
also stated that Charley Mclaughlin had not
been seen for several days and would not put 10
his appearance at all. So there was but very
poor prospect for millerite engagement In the
ring. Several impromptu affairs were gotten up,
the most earnest Of which was between Tip

few weeks since, in another no.fght arrange
ment, whilst he was making an unsuccessful at.
tempt to get away with a bottle from a neigh.
boris pocket. On the present occasion, mickey""
was equally unfortunate In his undertaking, and
came out Of the eight saying that 1t was ""a little
too jammy for him In there""


About 7 O'Clock a carriage drove up to the
door of tho tavern from which Bolster alightel
ALA al and ,lya tnIn he hn.aI
whore ho laid down on cot. He was accompa-
MED by Charley Nugent and Lemond.


About half an hour afterward Sorrell arrived,
accompanied by Mike Car, his trainer, and Bill
Sorrell, his brother, and were taken into the
same room rs that occupied by Bolster. sorroll
was closely wrapped in heavy shawl, wore q
black coat and corduroy psntaloons.


While they were in the room a few OF the
friends were admitted, and there was much con-
lecture as to what had become Of Bowie and
Mclaughlin. Mike Carr asserted that Nc
Laughlin was In Toledo, Ohio. Another as
serted that he was thirty miles on his way to
Lynchburg.


In little time, however, Johnny Clarke, Bo-
wie's hacker, came In and said he wished to
state that he had brought Bowie to the house,
and during the night he got up, took his blan-
kets aud LEFT, and that Bowie was q loafer, 4
coward and sooundrel, and had already taken
$500 out of his pocket.


Mike Carr said, ""Yes, he took IN overcoat,
too"" and that ""he mustn't turn up""


Ono of McLaughln's friends, who also held
the stakes in tho Bowie and Sorrell match, here
stated that he would let tho reporters know all
about the patter in a few minutes and returned
and said, ""Charlie Mclaughlin is sick and for.
feits to Bolster. All tho outside bots are of; and
that ends this match. ""


In reply to a quection, he stated that Ne.
Laughlin was sick with the bilious fever, and
his physician would not agree that he should
fght. II was finally agreed that Bolster and
Sorrell should put in their appearance in the
olared their property. This the men did at
about S:iJ q. M, when Sorrell said he had come
fully prepared to fight, but that his man was
nowhere to be found. This was received with
voeiferous cheering. Bolster here announced
that no ono need challenge him hereafter for he
would never fight again,


No mill now appearing In tho prospective, q
tall marine, named Sauers, who was spelling for
fight, sprRng into the ring, as he did at the
frt Collyer and Aaron fsht, and dared any man
to come In and fight him. John Charles. of Bal.
timore as quickly responded by leaping in with
him. and, in less time than It takes to toll It,,
both men were stripped to the waist. Friends Of
both parties, however, would not let them get
together, and they were compelled to resume
their harness, Next Mike Carr, alias Engsh,
the trainer of Sorrell and Bolster was appealed
to to fight somebody but this man, who had put

since the other fights failed, but that he would
train for and fight any man of l2S pounds, south
of Washington, for from $500 to 81, 600, Charley
Douglass and Billy Connolly were, in turn, put
up for u 6ght and finally it seemed that one
would be had the following named persons being
conspicuous in cndoavoring to get it up, or feel.

Kelly, John Charles, Martin Cloary, alias ""Crow
Hill,"" ex. confederate Gen. Writ Adams, Johnny
Clarke, Rnd others.


Just here the cries of ""police,"" ""tho military
are coming"" ""skedaddle,"" &c, were shouted
by several persons, and tho ""mill.race' proved
to bo an extraordinary one, about one third Of
the party escaping before they were surrounded
by hfty.fOur men Of Company 18th United
States artillery, from Battery Rogers, and the
Alexandria police, headed by Mr. j. NJ. Stewart,
sheriff of Alexandria county. Tho military was
commanded by Lieuts Jones aud Howe. who

The RECONSTRUCTION INJpscrros GASES
After the reading Of number Of opinions yps,
tsrdsy in the United States Supreme Court. At
torney General Stanbery proceeded to reply TO
tho argument OF Hon. Robert J. Walker, made
on Friday last, In these eases. Mr.. 6tsnbery had
In tho outset on his motion 10 dismisg Ipa eases
for want Of Jurisdiction. Tho court, he com
tended, could not entertain the case: First, be-
cause Of the parties. Tho Secretary Of War was
tho agent Of the President, and the official acts
Of that Secretary wero the executive acts Of the
President Secondly, tho court could not take
cogniEance Of political questions such as those
presented for its consideration In these cases.
There must always be wrongs for which there Is
no redress and the argument, therefore, that
unless the court would grant the injunction
asked the mischief done By the execution Of tho
law would be irreparable, smounted to nothing.
Congress could completely, II it chose, break up
this court by withholding appropriations for II
or by impeaching tho judges on false charges
So II is absurd to say thore IL redress for all
wrongs under the Constitution. There is none
for many political wrongs except In tho ultimate
good scnso Of the people. Tho argument is con-
cluded, and II only remains for tho court TO pass
upon It's merits and render judgment.

gina, since she promises to become in the
future everything which she has not been in
the past. AS the mother of great men, she
has exhibited coRlplacency which the fasti-
dious in language might denominate arrogance,
but as the nurse of many happy and prosper
GUS and well-educated communities, she will
have more equitable claim upon the appro-
baton of mankind. The American idea Of
public greatness is not that of rare and isO-
lated individual distinction, but rather OF
capacity for public affairs so generally diffused
that the incapable are the exceptions. Our
theory excludes hereditary honOrs and family
distinctions, the boast of heraldry and the
pomp of power yet it was to precisely these
social features that oldschool Virginans clung
with a tenacity which poverty rather ntensi-
fed than abated. The democracy of the State
was of a purely theoretical character-it was
doctrine without embodiment, and profession
without practice. Prudence, economy, enter
prise commercial and agricultural assiduity,
were almost unknown. There were great
landed estates held by individuals, but they
were often wastefully managed, often unpro-
ductive, and not seldom through mistaken no.
tions of hospitality source OF positive en-
barrassment to their titular owners. The con-
sequence was kind of splendid squalor, like
nothing so much as the hand-t0-mouth magnih-
cenco once so common in Ireland. 81 was once
present"" says Noah Webster, ""at an enter
tainment given by young planter In Vir-
"" ginia, who had much land, and many slaves.
He arose at two o'clock next morning, pawned
""his knee-buclles, and some other articles
gave his landlord note for sixty dollars
"" and rode off without paying his hair-dresser.""
""I once heard Washington remark adds Mr..
Webster, that from the Northern to the
Southern States the agricultural improve
ments are in an inverse proportion to the
number of slaves"" These little extracts con-
tain whole Libraries of political economy.


In such condition of affairs, 1t was only
natural that public education should be neg
lected There were one or two dilapidated and
ill-managed colleges for the rich, but for the
poor there was scarcely any educational pro-
vision Whatever. There were a few Yankee
school-masters employed, but Halleck, the
poet, humorously mentions the contempt In
which these rowing pedagogues were held by
the aristocratic planters. The majority of these
not only did not profess to desire public edu-
cation, but they deprecated it as'unnecessary,
dangerous, demoralizing. In our own time we
have heard Gov. Wise passionately hurting his
inyectves against the common school system
of New-England and denOuncing the spread
Of knowledge with ludicrous vehemence. He
was among the last of the Virginian aristo-
Gratis. The breed may be considered extinct
with the social system which produced and
fOstered 1t.


We beg that our sentiments may not be mis-
understood We should find no pleasure In
dwelling upon these features of by-gone era
if we were unable to contrast them with the
dawn of better days. We can point with en-
couraging triumph (whatever may be the feel
ings of Gov. Wise) to the Virginia Teachers
Convention lately held in Lynchburg; to the
proposed establishment of State Department
of Public Instruction; to the admission at the
Convention, that education is the right or the
masses, and should be afforded at the public
charge No less parsonage than Gen. Lee
made report on school discipline, breathing,
il we may say so, the very spirit OF the late
Horace Mann. An extract from this report has
already appeared in these columns, ana our
readers will agree with us in the opinion that
clearer and more orthodox sentiments could
hardly have been set forth even in Massachu-
sets. Gen. Lee evidently knows how to repair
the damages which he has helped to infict,
and has found out very persuasive method OF
leading loyal men to forgiveness and forget
funess of the past.


There are two ways of favorably regarding
established systems Of Public Instruction. In
the first place, the sentiments, opinions, mo-
tiyes which induced their establishment, are all
of happy augury. And these arc Independents
OF comparative success or failure. The noble
desire dignifes the experiment. The mere wish
for social culture is, in itself, one Of the most
liberal of feelings. The ignorant father who
determines that his son ! shall have better
chances, cost what of selstdenial they may, has
already himself taken Q degree, 1t Is only of"

influence of liquor. This really furnishes no
ground for pardon-rather it aggravates the
case. No man has any right to plead drunk,

mission of crime. Still, drunkenness is con,
filming thousands in prison-reducing thou,

Tho journal Of Thursday last was then read.


The Speaker laid before the House certificate
Of the Governor Of Kentucky OF the election In
August last Of Mr. J. s. Goiliday az tho success.
sor Of Hon. Elijah Hise.


Mr.. Dawes, Of Mass, thought this should take
the same course as the other Kentucky cases, In
order that the whole subject might be investi
gated and reported upon at one hearing: He
moved its reference to the Committes on Rleo
tions, and that pending investigation the mem
bers be not sworn In.


Mr.. Adams. Of Ky, made brisf siatsmsnt In
explanation Of the condition Of things In the
congressional district, Of which Mr.. Gollidsy
claimed to be q representative. At the May
election Mr. Hise was elected by q majority Of
over Q, 900 over his competitor, Mr.. Blake. De
fore receiving his certificate Mr.. Hiss died, and
Mr.. Blake then came here and claimed to be
the Representative. A special election was held
with the proper certificate. He (Mr. Adams
had no objection to the reference Of the creden.
tials, but thought the ordinary rule should pre-,
vail, and Mr.. Golliday should be sworn In.


Mr.. Paine, Of Wis, said this was q peculiar
case. Mr.. IIise died before he received q certia
cato, and then Mr.. Blake came here-not to
contest Mr.. Hise's sent, as he would have done
If Mr.. Hise had lived, but to claim his election
by majority Of the legal votes cast. Tho sub
ject was referred to the election committee, and
testimony was taken. Until the case was 70
ported 1t cannot be known who Is entitled to the

there was vacancy, and ordered new election

It would be improper for the House to declare

object TO the reference, but the not swearing In
Of Mr.. Golliday. That was the rule Of th,
House, and It should DO observed In this case.
Mr. Dawes contendod that the fact of new
election did not alter the condition Of the case
The Honso had referred the matter to q commit
tee, and ordered an investigation. The Cover
nor Of Kentucky had overstepped his mark II
ordering q new election, and the House coult
not say II a vacancy did exist until the com
mittee had reported.


Mr. Bingham, Of Ohio, asked IL the msmbel
was sworn In and the order Of reference wa
made, whether that would finally decide th,
matter and foreclose the question


Mr.. Dawes replied that 1t would be rathe
irregular, under tho circumstances, to swear il
the applicant.

Yesterday the examinations Of the eolored
schools were continued by Rev. John Kim l..
bali, superintendent of the freedmen's schools
In this department, and NJ. T.. Newton, super
intendent Of the schools of the American Freed
mems Association.


On leaving Miss Browns school in Galbraith
Chapel, they proceeded to the basement of the
Baptist church, corner of Fourth and l.. and
examined the school supported by the Penn
sylvania branch of the Freedmen's Commits
sion, and taught by Miss g. F. Wilmington.
The school is one Of the primary grade, and
n numbers 81 on the roll, of whom SO were pres
ent, divided into three cIasses-tw in the first
reader, and one in the primer. The ages Of the
pupils range from six TO ten, with one or two
Older; and in the studies the examination was
good, particularly IN mental arithmetic, and
the promptness with which the answers were
given was somewhat surprising. Although
the pupils are just about the ages to be diff ult
to keep in order, the behavior was excellent.
The school is held in the basement of the
church, and W lille 1t is sufficiently large for
school purposes, there is not enough Of light
Rev ID. p. Jones, coIoreo, and a few of the
parents OF the pupils were present during th he
examination, and expressed their appreciation
at the success OF the examination. This is the
second year Of this school.


The schools at Kendall Green were next Wis
tied, and the first school, the primary, taught
by Mrs. q. Baldwin, and supported by the New
York branch of the kreedmen's Commission,
was examined. There are 90 names on the
roll OF this school, and rs pupils were present.
Most OF the pupils are small; and while there
appears TO be considerable energy displayed by
the teacher, there seems to be some lack of sys-
TEN, wi hich is doubtless owing to the number
being too large TOR management of one teacher
The examination was only fair one, but there
were some pupils very well up in their studies
and one little seven year old, called Johnny,
seemed to be prodigy in geography.


The second school in the same building and
supported by the same association is an in
termediate, and is under the charge of Miss q.
f. Williams There were i2 pupils of As on

they acquitted themselves admirably. In
spelhng tney were extra good and one OF the
boys did not miss spelling single word, al
though the most difficult In the book were
propOunded. They were also well up in
arithmetic and dictation; but the reading was
only ordinary


A feature in this school was the recitations
in con cert OF selections Of Psalms, &c. There
was good attendance of the parents, who
seemed to take much interest in the exercises,
and at the close Messrs. kimbalI and Newton
addressed the pupils, congratulating them ON
their attainnents.

IN every village, and a gibbet at ever,


cross road. That these leaders do not


believe what they teach, is sufficiently
proved by the eagerness with which


some OF them returned to the protec


ton of the American flag after having


abSconded to Mexico and elsewhere. in


anticipation of the punishment then


conscience told them was Justly their


due. But they have returned, and


under the miraculously animating


influence Of Executive pardon, have


recovered the use of their tongues and


pens. They have inaugurated a regular


and organized campaign of resistance


to the government, and deception OF


the people, similar to the secession


campaign of 1860, and probably for


the same end. They bring a general


charge of unconstitutional despotisnl


against the government. Ask them


for the specifications, and amid a


torrent Of empty words and a deafen>


ing clamor, no ground is discovered


for the charge except that the govern


ment chooses TO protect itself against


destruction by disfranchising some of


those who once attempted to destroy


it. Never before has the press been


more liccntious, never has speech


been more free, never have the rights


of person and property been more


sacred than now, under the abhorred


military rule. We hear of fewer riots,


fewer mobs, less lynching, than under


the regime Of that much yearned for
civil law.


Can the press complain of want of
liberty? No onc intcrferes, not even


by enforcing the law of libel, while it


villi6cs and maligns every one who


dares to advocate the adoption of the
terms Of settlement which Congress has


proposed. The press has il all its own


way, for there is no means by which


contradiction Of its slanders can be got
before the majority Of the people-few
organs by which its malignant influence
can be ncutralized. 1t runs its muck
uncontrolled and unrcstraincd. Govern
ment officers, to say nothing of State
and County officers, who are nothing
if not sccesh, but Federal civil officers
suffer the government to be vilIifed, and
the misrepresentation of the press to
be repeated, in their presence without
a rebukc. Are their mouths SO full of
government bread that they can say
nothing in favor Of the hand that feeds
them? The government permits the
press freely TO stab private charac-
ter and TO SOW treason broadcast,
apd 10 proclaim a war, nf IL
allows II to excite the people to rebellion,
without a word Of remonstrance. The
press destroys as fast as the government
attempts to build up, and this terrible
despoijSm quietly Succumbs, and its
aai,dps the commanders ofthc military
districts as pOwerless as the first
king of 4Esops frogs - very suggestive
fable, by the way.


Is there any restraint upon the
liberty OF speech? Ben H. Hill is
allowed to preach scdition and incite to
revolt, almost under Gen. Pope's
windows The general may not
consider Hills speech as dangerous
enough to notice, because there is in it
about the same proportion Of reason to
nonsense rs there was of bread to sack
in Fallstalf's tavern hill. But many peo-
pie are to be caught with chaf, and mis-
take vitupcration for argument so Ben
exerts his malicious influence, un-
checked. 1t the military law is powcrless
to reach such orators is there no law
in Georgia against common ScOlds?


Has personal liberty been unwarrant
ably invaded by this de$potism ? When
and where in Georgia has any citizen
been punished or tried by military
since the present rule was
established ? Who is the man that has
been deprived Of life, liberty or property |
except by sentence of civil law? True,
there has been less cause for the inh;c-
ton of punishment, but if the fear of
the military law restraints from crime, it
is far better for all good citizens, than
our old fashioned civil law, which no
evil doer feared Or respected.


In fine, this is the ""mildest manner-
cd' of deSpotisms. Not man has been
punished for treason or reasonable |
sentiments-they are permitted to be
proclaimed from the house tops. Would |
those who so vehemently denounce its
have been better satisfied |
with the massaeres of Queretaro ? Yet
they would have US believe that the |
rule Of General Pope is worse than the
cruel tyrannies of Juarez and ESco'
bcdo! Congress might have refused to |
admit us into the Union upon any con-
litions, and held the South rs con-
4uered territory, subject to such
penalties for treason as it saw
fit; now, when it proposes to restore
us to all our rights and equality in the
Union, upon terms the most lenient
ever offered to any conquered people,
it is met by the bowling of Tray,
Blanche and Sweetheart, ""little dogs
and ALL"" about the tyranny Of the
terms and their unconstitutionality |
and it takes no pains to silence its
revilers-those deceivers, misleading
the people again to their own destruc-
ton. As if we, who had repudiated all |"

about Q o'clock, q lad by the name Of Charles A.
Green, son Of Thomas Green, letter carrier, 70!
siding on G street, near First street west. was
killed BY being run over by one Of tho -Four.
teenth. street cars at the Baltimore depot. The
facts as ELECTED, proved that tho car was being
backed down on the main tack, preparatory to
leaving on It's regular trip, and that the boy at.
tempted 10 get on from the rear. He succeeded
In getting on, but fell of as the car was sing
on another track, the wheels passing over his
head, crushing II In the most horrible manner,
the brains Of tho child running over the track.
Tho car was immed ediately stopped and the lad
picked up by Officer Brewer and conveyed to the
residence of his parents. Dr. Munder was sum
moned, but medical skill was Of no avail as the
little sufferer breethed his last In ten minutes
from the occurrence. In the absence Of the cor.
oner by sickness, a jury was summoned at the
house by Justice Walter, composed Of the fol.
lowing gentlemen Messrs. Thomas Thornley,,
foreman Chris Boyle, J. Terrence, D. O'Brien,
Patrick Welsh, s. D. Houch, A. Lsutner, s N.
Smith. *. Brewer, @. Pierce, A. Borden, and
Charles Jones.


After hearing the testimony, the jury rendered
q verdict that ""the deceased, Chas. A. Green,
came to his death this November 2, 1867, by the
wheels of a railroad car on Now Jersey avenue,
running over his head, and crushing him to
lueatnt ue having attempted 10 nhng on Outsiuo
OF said car. And the Jury do further agree that
the persons in charge Of tho car at the time arc
not censurablo for neglect of duty""


The sad affair created much excitement in tho
vicinity, and we do hope tha, the warning will
not pass unheeded.

FENIAN AFFAIRS.
Col. Lynch Speaks His Mind.",,"TORONTO, Jan. 3.-Col. Lynch is out in a
letter column long, addressed to the editor of
the Irish American In New York. in which he
says that he has no desire for notorietv, but he
Is reluctantly obliged to notice a sIanderous
editorial IN that paper, every word OF which
is an unmitigated falsehood. and that such
vltuperation could only emanate from paid
hirelngs, living on the honest earnings of their
countrymen. He states, and chaIlen ges con-
tTadicuon, tnat from the second of June the
100 prisoners here never directly or Indirectly
received assistance from the Een enian head q mar
ters OF other source except a small sum from
+. U. Day, OF Buffalo, for the Buffalo priso.
ners. He states that he wrote to p. o. Ilay to
call the attention OF the Fenian authorities tn
the case, but nothing was done and that the
editorial in the New York Tribune about a
specisl agent being sent, who called on the
American Consul here and proffered relief
had not one word Of truth in IT.


Col. Lynch says he has no desire for a con :
trovsrsy with Roberts, and that he belle YES the
Fenian organization is the best ever estab
lished to promote unity among Irishmen in
America. This object alone entities il TO the
support OF true Irishmen


Col. Lynch concludes with a sarcastic allu
sion to Roberts desire that he should be hanged
In order to replenish his (Robertsl treasury."

Mr.. Clabaugh presented resolution amending
an ordinance relating to additional revenue.
Passed.


Also, . petition to pay claim Of Walsh 4
Lynch. Passed.


Mr.. Davidson reported resolution authoriz-
Ing steam ferry and relating to licenses.


Mr.. Davis said he was placed in q peculiar po-
sition. He was in favor Of the proposed ferry,
but by the contemplated increase Of license It
would amount to $4, 900 per year, and ho could
not vote for SO much money-$2O, 900 for Ave
lyears-as bonus for q steam ferry. He be-.
lieved rates Of toll as provided In the bill would
amply repay the owners for constructing the
ferry.


Mr.. Davidson advocated the passage of the
bill, and said tho establishment Of a steam ferry
must bring increased trade and travel to the
town, and hoped the bill would pass.


Mr.. Shoemaker said he was in favor Of paying
| Q certain sum for the bonus, and not make taxa.
tion any higher. lie was In favor Of appropriat.
ing 81, 900 as q bonus, which could bo raised
from licenses or taxes. He did not think the
benefits to be derived from the ferry would be
felt by all the people alike, and he was opposed
to making those who received no benefits pay
, additional license.


Mr.. Clabaugh said In regard to the ferry, II
was the universal wish Of the people to zee II
tablished, and he thought Mr.. Davis estimated
the increase Of the licen,e at rather too high q
figure, when he said 1t would amount to 81, 900
per annum. He hoped the bill would pass or be
so amended as to secure to the people Of George
town at once the privilege of steam commqnica-
tion with the Virginia shore.
Mr.. Ramsburg was in favor Of the establish
ment Of the ferry and thought the corporation
should extend some aid to the protector. lie
believed every housekeeIsr would be benefited,
as communication would be easy with the Vir-
ginia shore. 1t Was not tho intention of Mr.
Tennoy to make money out of tho ferry, but to
increase trade The ferry would cost $40 00O
and Mr.. Tenney desired to form a Joint stock
company as he was not able himself to bear the
whole Of the expense. Mr.. Ramsburg desired to
have the measure receive tho unanimous ap.
proyal Of the Board.


Mr.. Davis mSved to recommit the bill, that
tho committee might bring In ono naming a
specific sum as bonus for the establishment of
the ferry, and not increase the licenses.


Mr.. RamSburg hoped the matter would not be
delayed, and If recommitted that the committee
report at once.


b Mr.. Davis said that tho corporation was not
discreet. The aqueduct was a great question,
and II the people and the corporation would now
act In unison that structure might bo forever
closed TO canal purposes, and an appeal toe Con.
gress no doubt would result in a wagon road be.
Ing constructed over the bridge.


After some further debate the bill was recon.
mittsd.


Mr.. Davis moved that the vote be reconsiderod
BY which the bill was recommitted, In order that
be referred to the Board OF Aldermen.

continent to the obscene mumbo jueb0s OF

stead OF striking the foul and accursed fol-
lowers OF these hideous African deitjes with
thunderbolt at once. does the Almighty de-
sign for them an infinitely greater punish
ment than Immediate distinctions Well,
time can only determine the matter. We
only know that they deserve death. utter an.
Initiation from the fair earth they have dis
figured with their crimes and polluted with
their hthy and unpronounceable sins. Thirty
years ago, when they first proposed their
monstrous and Atheist; Idea the in.
stincts of the people were so outraged. that
they would have extermnated them from the
land, had not the police interfered. Ignorant
people fancy this was prejudice"" but the
| instinct that prompted Dan. Sckles, Capt
Rynders and others, to lynch Garrison and
his gang, was planted in their hearts by the
Almighty Creator, and they only obeyed His
will when they sought to annihilate these in
]
by their presence. 1t was the instinct of
preservation, imperative, all pervading,
overwhelming, written by the finger Of God
Himself in their organization, the absolute
proof of which is now apparent, or should be
apparent to all thinking men. Had Dan
Sickles, Capt. Rynders and others, who,
thirty years ago, sought to exterminate Gar
rlson and his crew, succeeded, had they, on
a certain day massacred every abolitionist on
American soil, this sublime manifestation OF
popular justice would have saved the country
million of lives and ten thousand millions
OF property What an awful truth to con
slder-a truth that no sane man in all this
broad hand will dare to question. Had there
been no abolition party there would have
been no Abraham Lincoln. no sectional COM
binatlon OF States to usurp the government,
no secession TO escape that combination. no
war or conflict whatever, and the whole Am.
erican people would now be rejoicing in
peace and prosperity.


Did they deserve determination Of course
they did, just as pestlence the small pox,
any and all things that conflict with the laws
of life or that threaten the self preservation
of the people. Here were white men and.
negroes, both human, of course. but widely
different human beings, having different ma.
lures and different wants. and thereto de-
signed by the A lmighty Creator for different
&c 'nditions, uses and duties. These foul and
Atheistic wretches propose to "" abolish"" the
design of the Creator, and force wines and
negroes to amalgamate together, Just as we
do with varieties or nationaities of our own
species! lhe whole organic nature shrinks
from this monstrous sin. and since the world
began, no such sentiment as sexual love ever
occurred between whites and negroes. But
Garrison 4 Co. proposed that they should so
associate on equal terms, 80 debauch their in
stincts by "" equal rights"" So. in short, de-
grade themselves into the same condition,
that at least all the instincts God gave them
should be utterly lost, and thew would then
mate and marry together! If this were pos,
slble, 1t, for example, a thousand abolitionists
were to practice this belief, and mate and
mngle their blood with as many negroes,
within given period, certa My in less than
hundred years, they would rot out and ut
terly perish from the EARTH polluted by their
sins against God and their own nature. The
proposal of Garrison. thereto.e, was death.
absolute extinction. and death the most mon
strous, polluting and beastial that even devils
themselves could contrive, as it were better,
infinitely better, to perish at ouce rather than





abolition of slavery, -"" imuartial freedom. -
mulattoism and final extinction. The in
stinct of the people to exterminate Garrison
and his filthy gang was, therefore, the in
stinct of self preservation, the inherent. all
pervading law of vital necessity. that impels
us to destroy all noxious and abnormal forces
that tend to our destruction whether it be>
yellow fever or small pox, mad dogs or aboli
tioniSts


We would appeal to reason. and show the
people that they should confine these aboii,
ton madmen in prisons, and put them through
a course of treatment that should cure them
ot their monstrous and ahhorrent crimes
against nature and natures God but the
SlckieseS and kynderses. representing the
natural instincts of the masses, obey the law

morning, 25th inst, were horror STRICKEN ny
Mr.. Thomas r. George coming into town
and reporting that the body of a negro man
was hanging on willow along the road
leading to the railroad, ON the corner OF MIR.
John Saughter's farm, about n mile out OF
town. Many citizens visited the scene OF
the tragedy He was very dark-hued and
about % to ""a years old, and supposed to
weigh from 1870 to 140 pounds. He had
been working on farm with William 4.
Collins, at Martins Bridge. Last nignt
about o'clock, while Mr.. Collins and his
wife were absent visiting neighbor, some |
five or six unknown persons in disguise,
came to his house and called the boy out
into the yard, when he was set on, tied, car |
ried off, and hung from the tail OF u cart or
wagon OF some sort, as the tracks oi wheels
were seen under the corpse. No cause can
he assigned for tins fearful outrage. MIR.
Collins out buildings were fired and burnt
to the ground on Monday night last, anu
some suppose that this fire had something
to do with the hanging, as there were good
grounds to suspicion this boy, who was re-
cognized to be VIM. Evans, but there is not
the least evidence that any one that had the
least interest in the property destroyed had
any completely in the hanging. 1t is a sad
case, as he was considered perfectly loyal,
and had served several years in the war.


ANOTHER ACCOUNT.


The Dover DeldWdTedn of Saturday says:
We learn that II negro man, named VIM.

hung, by unknown parties, on account Of

Coroner will make thorough investigation
of the matter, and bring the parties guilty
of this outrage to Justice. There is no ex-
{ cuse or palliation for lynch law In Kent
County, and it should not be tolerated. The
Coroner held an inquest on the body on
Thursday, and the jury found that Obie
came TO his death by hanging al the hands
7 of five men, to the jury unknown.


8 After the above was in type we received
j the following;


LEIPsIc, DEL, July 20, 1867


This morning, at an early hour, the body
@ of negro man was found by neighbors
l. passing along the public road, suspended
if from the limb of a willow tree, on the south


east corner of the farm Of John Slaughter
y about mile from Lelpsic, at the junction o
IS the road leading from the direction OF Mar
e Tins Bridge and Morton. He was hunl
T. with common plow line, his feet about Il
:. OF 20 inches from the ground. There wer,
y wagon tracks under the body, which showe(
!, that he was hung from wagon or carrag
"" Of some kind He was identified as a VIM
y Evans, alias Obie, and had been living witt
Mr.. VIM. I. Collins, at Martins Bridge. Las
~ night, in the absence of Mr.. Collins and hi
n wife, who were visiting his father, some per
le sons in disguise called the boy out of III
!, house on the pretence of engaging him I


cut oats for them. He was roughly seized
Z"" tied and placed in kind OF peach wagon
n and drawn off in the direction OF Leipsit
al This took place about 8 or 10 o'clock in tn
90 evening. He was seen hanging last nigh


about 10 O'Clock, by some members OF Mr.
n Mary Cowgill's family, who were returnin
Ill from Leipslc. There were supposed TO |
w. six or eight persons engaged in the hanging
l,c but as they were completely disguised reco
~ nition was impossible. On Monday last, NJ
ID Collins outbuildings were burnt, and susr
ur cion rested on tins boy Evans, as being Il
nd perpetrator OF the act, as it was undoubted
10 a case of arson, and it is supposed that th


fire had something 10 do with the lynchn


No one is suspected OF being engaged in
'cs that we are aware of. His body, at III
he writing, Is still hanging, waiting the arriv
tes of the Coroner. G. w. S.

u"" George G. Gordon, Esq, was informed
ors by officer Heritage, for allowing his dog
thc be unmuzzled in the public streets contra
an to the ordinance The evidence of ofic,

says, we are reliably informed that if the
Grand .July don t investigate the case of mob
violence near I.eipsc he wW take the matter
an hand himself: that it is an outrage against
law and the well being Of society and must
not be overlooked. This is very fair talk on
the part Of the Governor, but it hardly meets
the case. Why has he not offered reward
for the arrest Of the guilty parties, as he would
probably do in other cases of murder, and not
wait to see whether the Grand Jury would do
its duty or not! lie ought to take "" hold OF
the matter himself"" without regard to the
Grand Jury.


We are also informed, reliably, that the
Governor expresses the opinion that the act
was political move, perpetrated by the Re
publicans to bring the State into disreputc
and cause the Interference of Congress and the
Freedmen Bureau in their behalf. If the
Governor 50 believe he may take the necessary
steps to bring the parties to justice; and lie
will hardly throw the duties upon the Grand
Jury, either As the Grand Jury does not s
until October we should think he would wan
10 investigate the case before that lIenod an(
thwart the plans Of the Radicals. That tn
demands of justice might be met it were we
for him to 50 believe. But does he so believe


The Freedman Bureau has already give
attention to the matter. Coroner Cats ha
been written to by the Secretary Of the Burea
at Wilmington, to give the facts in the case
and we learn that the Officers of the Burea
have requested the State authorities to invel
tigate it at once From all we can learn ther
would be but little difficulty in fcrrcting OF
the GUILTY. nartieS."

past an old Chinaman has occupied cabin
near Wright & Bedford's store, at Texas
Springs, and engaged in gambling, and sell
ing opium and other Chinese articles to his
countrymen. About four O'Clock last Mon
day morning persons sleeping III the vicinity
were awakened by the explosion of innumer-
able fire crackers, and on going out to ascer-
tain what was up, beheld the China store in
flames. A few minutes after the discovery
of the fire, one end of the cabin caved in. and
revealed the body of the proprietor lying on
the floor, with one leg and arm burnt off. -
Amos Young procured a shovel and pulled
the dead Celestial out of the burning build
ing, and found that he had been killed by a
blow from some instrument that had penp.
trated the brain above the left temple. On
being notified of these facts. Coroner Lynch
proceeded to Texas Springs and held an
inquest on the remains. The jury, after in
vestigation, rendered verdict that deceased
came to his death by violence at the hands of
some person or persons to them unknown
The deceased was supposed to have $500 OF
5000 about his cabin, and it is thought he
was killed for his money, and that the house
was then set on fire."

which bas prevailed for the past two weeks
has dried the roads up wonderfully, and left

of the opportunity thus afforded, and are

daily. Bush & Co. and Daniel Lynch have
received fresh supplies of groceries, pro-
visions, and such other goods as are usually
kept in grocery stores. Coleman is in receipt
of an additional stock of hardware and coal,
and Manasse is replenishing his stock OF
school books, stationery, cigars and tobacco.
R. Isaacs & Co. have commenced receiving
their usual spring assortment of dry goods,
and in the course of few weeks their estab

This body, which recently assembled at
Montsomery, Ala., adjeurned sine dss on the
17th instant. The M Montgemery AaiP says:


The session has been most harmonious and
productive OF much good feeling and religious
intercourse, though the union OF the TWO Me-
move IN that direction has been made, how
ever, and 1t is very probable the churches Will
be united in at least twelve months time. The
following report on The subject OF the proposed
union was adopted: .... ..## S..


1.-The com mitIee to whom were referred the
several papers on the subject of union between
the Methodist Protestant Church and the
MerhCdlst Episcopal Church South have had
the same under consideration, and respectfully
reIort:


""Tnat they regard the proposed union as
highly desirable, both for the interest of Meth
Cd.sm and of our common Christianity, il it
can be effected upon terms n utnaiiy agreeable:
that although portion of the church, as we
are advised. is prepared at this time 10 con
Glade the nion on the terms proposed; vet,
Ihasmuch as an honest difference of opinion
exists among Us in this respect, and no de-
cisIon can be reached by this body at its
present session that will insure harmony and
lied action, we therefore respectfully rec
emmsnd


""lst. That the conveSao on take no decisive
action at this time but fhat the whole subject
be held in abeyance and under advisement by
the several annual conferences, calmly await
lag ihe development and indications of Provi-
tenCe.


I'D. That commission. consisting OF one
Htmber 1r""m eScn conference here repre-
seDted, elected by each delegation in this con-
venton, be appointed to meet the COMMISSION
OF 'he Methodist Episcopal Church South, on
the first day of May, 1885, in the meantime the
several annual conferences OF the Me- thodist
Episcopal Church South and the Methodist
Protestant Church may consider many of
the dlsagreeing propositions between the
two commissioners of the Methodist Episcopal
church South and the Methodist Protestant
Cnurch as they may deem proper, and
submit the result to their respective commits
sions. Then, if a majority of the commission
ers OF the Methodist Protestant Church decide
that, in their judgment, the propositions sub
mltted TO them are sufficiently favorable, they
shall publish in the Methodist Protestant
newspaper call for this con ventien to meet
in the city OF Lynchburg, on the last Friday in
May, 1868, and, If it deems it proper, to con.
clude any proposed union.


I'D That any annual conference properly
connected with the Methodist Protestant
Church, not represented here, be requested to
appoint one commissioner to meet with this
commission"

Vile, and Boston precir cts poll lists,
which, If excluded, woule have entitled
Mr. veech to mis- seat. The commissioners,
however, awarded the certificate of elec-
tion to Mr.. Mosely. Mr.. Veech, we learn,
has taken steps to contest the seat of Mr..
Mosely before the next Legislature.


At the congregational meeting of the
Presbyterian Church last week at Dam

and Testimony party for the purchase of
the church building was accepted. The
building was valued at $4,000, and they
purchase the interest of the General AS

between $1,000 and 5000. IS to De equally

changes in the Cabinet. These parties in instances,
urge Mr. johnson "" make three further removals,
but. generally. complaints are leyelcd at the ia.
cumbents OF the State aud Treasury Departments
only. They assert that Mr. Seward is impracticabe
effete, and powerless for good that he should
be succeeded by statesman Of broader
views. vigorous, practicable and popular withal. OF
Mr. McCulloch ii is argued that. while be comes up
squarely to the support of tho President in great ques
tiOns brought before tho Cabinet, he nevertheless
substantially wars against the interests Of the Ad
ministration by distributing the patronage of his
department among the enemies OF Mr Johnson, with
view to strengthen himself personally among tho
Radcals.and secure the support OF his peculiar inan-
cial plans They say the vast patronage Of ile Treas
ury Departments doing disastrous execution against
the Administration, while the Secretary haisef
merely gives his vote of assent to the and
views of the President when they up for con-
sideration in the Cabinet. 1t is not made known 10
what extent these arguments have affected Mr..
johnson. but the gentlemen who present them
confidently assert that we shall soon have another
Secretary Of State, 3s well as a new Secretary
Of the Treasury. The members OF the Cabinet
having unanimously decided, few days ago, that it
is the duty of each owhdraw upon the slightest In
timat0n thathe President would accept their re5ig-

About two months ago il was announced in these
dispatches that Gen. Ords Order No. 5, which yrtu'
ally prohibited tho freedmen from taking part ia
politics would work mischief in the Generals depart
ment by giving the supreme control Of reconstruc-
ton in some of the States, especially Arkansas into
the hands of the disoyalists This was denied at
the time, but advices received from some OF the
most prominent men Of Arkansas during the past
few days confirms the prediction first made. Since
this order was issued, the freedmen in many of tho
counties of that State have, through fear of the
military authorities, refused to register so that they
can vote This i especially SO in Drew White Ouchta,
Union, Calhoun Columbia, Craighead and Dallas
counties In these and few other counties there
are % 900 colOred men who are entitled to registra
tisn Unless Gen. Ord rescinds his order, or carries
out his promise made at the time of issuing the or
der that before September he would designate con-
venient places where tho freedmen could register
the work of Reconstruction will be solely IN the
hands Of the disloyal. Many Of the most prominent
citizens Of the State, such as Secretary Of State
White, United States Marshall Mills. Gen. CAN'T,
and others, have peitioned Gen. C. II. Smith, COM
manding the military forces in the State to his
influence either to have the order rescnded or tho
promises made by Gen. Ord kept.

ern, at the south end OF the Long Bridge, and
paid for the same by knocking down the bar
tender (Wm. Ray) with a billy, and robbing
him OF about fifty dollars. A farmer from
Loudoun county, named johnson, was also,
and about the same time. robbed by tness sams
parties OF his coat, con tanning valuable papers.
After committing these outrages. the soldiers
entered skif lying by, and crossed the river
in the direction Of Georgetown. 1t Is thought
that the desperadoes are known.


The locomotive Rapldan was drawing a.
heavily loaded freight train slowly up the

the boiler blew out, taking with it all that part
Of the engine, an killing the engineer, George
Lynch, and the fireman, Henry Rose; No
other persons were at all Injured. Mr.. Roses
body was not much disfigured. and was merely
knocked down, while that Of Mr.. Lynch was
horribly mutilated, being tern into fragments,
scattered over large space, and some Por-
tens blewn a distance OF two or three hun
dred yards from the scene of the accident. HIS
head had rot been found at last accounts.


M X. Jones, the soldier stabbed last Wednes-
day, is, 1t is thought, likely to recover. L.
appears that Jones and Moulden had & quar-
rel about female, which resulted in Jones
making violent attack on Moulden. beating
the latter produced a two.bladed pen-knife
and inflicted two ugly stabs on the person Of
Jones, one in the left side of the abdomen and
the other in the back, below the shoulder
blade.

The nominations were made unanimous.


Mr. Bowen was introduced and said the nomi-
nations have been made and the candidates are
oil we'll worthy Of your support. II any preju-
dioes existed before the nominations they should
all be laid aside now. II you make long pull,
. strong pull, and pull all together, and you
will thus strike blow for freedom and humanity,
redeemed and saved from the blighting curse Of
slavery. Less than seven years ago, on this very
spot (here the Fifth ward club arrived and were
greeted with three oheers) q handful Of good
and true men assembled to ratify the nomination
Of Abraham Lincoln for President. II would
then have been hazardous for any one to hint at
universal suffrage-he would have been handed
over to Judge Lynch and would have farod
worse than did JEFF. Davis, who was Just released
from prison. He hoped the party would not only
vote on Monday next, but would work early and
late to secure the election, which was sought to
be defeated by disloysl press.


Major VIM. s. Morse here road resolutions,
which were unanimously adopted, and withheld
for revision.


Hon. J. J. Stewart, Of Baltimore, was intro
ducsd, and said: Although the contest involves
only the local officers, he agreed with the Ma
tionai Inteihgsneey that II would have bearing
In Its results, upon the politics Of the whole
country. You will bo called on here, my fellow
oountrymen, not because Of your nationality ol
your color, or that you have red hair, or, like
some Of our Democratic friends, with red noses,
on Monday next, to use the ballot the arst time
What are now considered privileges must be made
law matters Of fact. When they talked Of enamel
pating slaves In this country, men denounced
them as outlaws and robbers. Men must learn al
such ideas by tho use Of the ballot next Monday
There ere colored voters hero tonight who, 1t Ii
said, vers supported BY their masters. Now, hi
was Of opinion that they had supported the mas
tors, and now those masters ought to support the
eolorsd people on Monday next.

Here he announced the First and secont

Tho speaker said that judging from appear

As to the States that went Voluntarily out OF th
Union, they should come back only on such tern
as should be granted them.


The President asserted that the military re
construction bill gave plenary powers, mad
tyrants Of the officers, and women and childre
were at the mercy Of such despots. He spoke
severe terms against the decision In relation
the registry act. He held that, according
that decision, Robert Toombs, Of Georgia, coul

last year has been eveniu to the people OF
Canada. So accustomed had been to the freedom OF
commerce with the United States that ali our people
looked forward with certain dread to the closing OF
the treaty between the two countries Our government
did and IS uoing aii rnur honoraDiy be done in
duce the American government TO renew the Reciprocity
treaty, which had caused great commerce to spring
up between the two nations So far their efforts
boon in vain, and heavy duties have been imposed on
produce by the American government, partly from
q feeng of retaliation for fancod injuries Our ship

1866 reach 600 600 bushels while exports

barley and fail wheat has not gone 70 the United Sates

on our produce draw more heavily on The Western

q Glance Mt our columns will show. So FAR
ms we are able to judge, the candidates are
worthy and deserving men, in whose hands
the county government could be safely en-
trusted.


For the responsible Office of Sheriff there
are four aspiran;s-Hopping, Reagan, DAILY
and Greene. W. E. Hopping, the present
incumbent. has held the Office for two terms,
is n good man and citizen -one of God s own.
and is personally the most popular man in
the county. The only Offset to this popularity
is caused by the misfortune of having entered
into an agreement with party by the terms
of which he is compelled, as an honorable
man, to continue said party in employ until
the close of his present term of Office. Should
Mr.. Hopping secure re election we are
assured that an accommodating and cour-
teous gentleman will be installed as Under
Sheriff.


James Reagan is an old resident of the
county, and has efficiently and faithfully
discharged the duties of Deputy Collector
under J. w. Garden, for the past three
years If elected we are satisfied he will
make good officer. and will give satisfaction
to the public.


Tom Greene is also an old and well known
resident of the county, good citizen, and
liberal and generous hearted man. 1t sue
cessful in his aspirations, be will undoubted-
"" make an energetic and faithful officer


James DAILY, likewise an old resident OF
the county, is we'll and favorably known
lie possesses all the requisites necessary for
making a good and efficient Sheriff. No one
needs the Office more than he. Whether sue
cessful before the nominating Convention or
not. he has made hosts of friends during the
canvass by his fair and honorable represent
ations in regard to himself and opponents,
and will not be forgotten by the people
.bould he offer himself as candidate at
some future time.


Three candidates are announced for the
important Office of County Judge. c.
Bush, H. H. Shufleton and George k. Knox.
The present incumbent, c. C. Bush, has held
the Office several terms, and Is recognized by
common consent as being the best and most
efficient Judge the county has ever had. IL.
III. Shufleton and Geo. r. Knox are both old
pioneers and brother Justices of the Peace.
They are we'll known and esteemed through
out the coantv. Either of them would fill
the Office with credit.


For County Clerk there are but two candi-
dates-Charles Mcdonald and G. |. Taggart
both well known to the people of the coun-
ty. Mr. Mcdonald has held the Office for
two terms, has made record as q careful
and accommodating officer, and is perfectly
familiar with all the duties and details of the
position. He has given general satisfaction.
Mr. Taggart is known as an enterprising
citizen and good business man, and if elect
ed would make an efficient Clerk


For County Treasurer there is but one
candidate-F. B. Chandler, the present
incumbent The fact that Mr.. Chandler has
no opponent is satisfactory evidence that the
people appreciate his services as an officer, in
which we heartily concur.


For the honorable position>of Assembly
man there are four candidates-D. G. Ste
venson, II. J. Shurtlef, Perry Dryer and
Henry Jones. Either Of these gentlemen, if
elected, will faithfully represent the people
of the county in the Legislature.


For the important Office of County Assessor
there are two aspirants-A. P. Ladd and E.
M. Dixon. Mr. Ladd has held the position
for two terms and has made an excellent and
energetic officer. The fact of his having met
with an accident which has partially disabled
him for performing manual labor is an addi-
tional claim in his behalf. Mr.. Dixon,
resident of Horsetown, is we'll and favorably
known, and possesses the qualifications
necessary to make good Assessor.


For Coroner, we have Daniel Lynch, the
present incumbent Like Chandler, he has
no opposition, and is sufficient evidence that
he has given general satisfaction.


For the Office of State Senator two candi
dates are in the field. N. Chappell and c.
T. Ellsworth If elected, Mr. Chappell's
experience in legislative affairs qualities him
for at once becoming an active and efficient
member of the Senate, and would enable him
to effectively guard the interests of his con-
stituents. Mr. Ellsworth is well known to
majority of the people of the county as an
enterprising citizen and man of intelligence
and ability.


No candidates are announced for District
Attorney, but we presume the present efici-
ent and gentlemanly incumbent will accept
the nomination for second term. He has
made the best District Attorney we have had
for the past+en years.


The above list of aspirants affords ample
material from which to select an excellent
ticket, and one that will be a credit to the
Union party of the county. OF course we
have our individual preferences, but it is for
the people of the county to decide who shall
be successful. Their choice will be ours.

have much pleasure in rendering to Sheriff

humane treatment received for the past eight
months in the prison under his control, and
for the courteous and gentlemanly manner
with which he has complied with the wishes
of the prisoners, when consistent with his
official position.


To Dr. Small's professional services. the
prisoners are indebted for the unusual health
enjoyed The prisoners will always remem-
Der with gratitude the unremitting care and
attention of Gov. Sewers; though prompt
and efficient officer yet kind and generous
to the prisoners.


They take leave of him with the kindest
feelings of respect and regard Gov. Sewers
having done all in his power to make the
confinement as agreeable as the rules and
discipline Of the prison would permit. The
prisoners express thanks to William Lally,
the Governors Aid, for the accommodating
manner with which he has discharged his
duty. JOHN MCMAHON,

Sunday, October 18th, at the town of Canton,
Ohio, while the congregation was assembling
in the German Reformed Church, most
desperate and deadly assault was made by
Ferdinand Hoffman upon the person Of his
divorced wife, Caroline Yost. Approaching
her in the choir, he demanded few moments
conversation, which being denied, he asked
her TO kiss him, and while in the act of doing
so, he stabbed her with butcher knife
three times in the breast, and eight times In
the abdomen and on the limbs. The scene
was terrible. The heart-rending screams Of
the women, and the shouts OF the men as
the assassin fled from the scene of his assault,
were exciting in the extreme. The murderer,
with the butcheT-knlfe still in his hand,
streaming with the blood Of his victim, at
tempted to reach the railroad, pursued by
maddened and excited crowd, and was ar
rested in his flight by stalwart country
man, who compelled him to surrender. The
excitement at this point was intense, and
the general demand was that the monster
should be lynched on the spot. Prudent
counsels prevailed, and he was marched to
iail. At one point, the agonized mother of
tile unfortunate young woman confronted
the crowd, and, with large sized stick beat
the prlsoner over the head, while, at the
same time, he was beaten indiscuminately
by parties in the crowd, and another demand
was made for his immediate hanging. He
was, however, safely lodged in Jail. The
excitement is still very great, and numerous
threats are made to take the prisoner from
Jail. II is doubtful whether the lady can
recover. Hoffman is a desperate character,
and was released but ten days since from
the State prison. His only regret is that he
did not kill her at once."

Smith visited Hughes at his claim, and de-
manded settlement. but the latter objected
to doing so at that time, and asked until the
next day to arrange the matter. Smith in
sisted on an immediate settlement, and
Hughes positively refused. This led to hard
words, and then to blows, after which Hughes
procured gun, at sight of which Smith
started to leave on run. Hughes raised the
gun and fred at the retreating man, the ball
entering the feft side of the back, below the
hip, in the guteal muscles. and ranging for
ward, on the crest of the ilium, passed out
near the groin, inficting a wound about
eight inches in length. Hughes Immediately

there is nothing extraordinary whatever, but
whom we here kindly mmortalize by mention
ing his name, was sent to the House OF Cor
rection for four months for being IAN Idle ana

he abused the Judge with insOent abandon,
and received sixty days more for the Wlld

suppose, what you may call literary; if he were
nc might employ part of his seclusiOn from
the world, either in composing a satire upon
the fact that millions of idle people in all
parts of the country remain at large undlS-
turbed by the police, or else i'll giving us MS
views of the policy applying the Massa-
chusetts law to the great work OF recon
struction. In the most troublesome Southern
localities, if the idle and dsorderly persons
could be set to some useful work. and so forced
fu portion of their time to keep the peace, 1t
would not make much difference whether the
President meddled with the Major-Generals or
not. 1t might then be possible to hold Con-
vention without riot and an election without
the dread of one Nine-tenths OF all the
troubles which come to us by telegraph and cor
respondence are OccasiOned by vagabond social
element, by men to whom order is as painful
as hard work. and who pine in peace for the
pop of the pistol. Most of the disorder which
is so discouraging comes of lazinesS which Is
congcnital i'm great deal of the white blood of
Southern regions and which is never discarded
except for the excitements of riot orfor an atray
in front of the grocery. Industrious Southern
men with real stake in the country want
nothing so much rs peace; while there Is
nothing more thoroughly out of place and out
of season just at this time in those parts than
idleness There is an old saw that those who
will not work must not expect to
eat; but somehow they do eat and
drink, and smoke, and sleep the
sleep which they have not earned, and quarter
themselves upon unhappy society, and frustrate
the political economies, and make themselves
thoroughly improbable nuisances, sometimes
stealing, and sometimes begging, and always on
the look-o for n shindy or a lynching. In
the present condition of the Southern States, 1t
is nothing less than crime for anybody to
shirk his share Of the toll necessary to restore
prosperity; and we know no better method
of bringing the drOnes to reason than that
adopted with Michael of Boston. The jails
might be little crowded at first but, rather
than work, great many of the ragged cpl
cureans would commit suicide, and in time the
rest would muster energy enough to die natural
deaths. We are satisfied that it will be n fine
thing for the South when they are all defunct
and buried for we are perfectly sure that there
will never be another generation like them
thriftess, lazy, sensual, and lawless. We ad-
wise them to make the most of their present
opportunity, for we can assure them, we think
with perfect confidence, that their time is
short. We do not expect them to go volun-
tarly to work. but we do expect them to live
quietly and TO die speedily."

1t is getting to be serious question
among Christian men and women whether
we ought not to have Society for the
Prevention Of Cruelty to Children. We
had not recovered from the sickening hor-
rors Of the case Of the Rev. Mr.. Lindsay,
who whipped bis little son to death be-
cause the child would not say his prayers,
when we were called upon the other day
to record frightful instance Of child tor
ture near Hackensack, N. j., which fortu-
nately came to the knowledge Of the au-
thorities before IL eliminated in downright
murder.


A man and his wife, named Vanderbilt,
had taken an orphan child, one Mary
Ann Farrell, from an asylum, for the pur-
pose Of employing her as servant. For
about eleven months the husband knocked
her about with broomstick, and the wife
beat her with an iron dpper. They used
to take her to the cellar, strip her naked,
tie her up by the wrists, lash her with q
horsewhip till the blood ran down her
limbs, and then rub the raw flesh with
brine. She made her escape at last, and
was found one morning in the open fields,
with bare feet and legs, and wearing only
a single thin undergarment, so saturated
with blood and filth that it had to be
peeled from her body like scab.


She appeared in court with evidences oi
torture SO pitiful upon her person that
stout men wept at the spectacle. Her jaw
| had ham hrnEap. hnr hair had hppn torn
out by handfuls; her face was swollen and
deformed; her lips were cut open; her eyes
were blackened and SCARED; her whole
body was bruised and discolored. Little
wonder that the neighbors were with diff
Guilty restrained from wreaking Lynch-law
vengeance on the authors Of the outrage"

Several communications were read in rela-

Boards of Trade, to take such united action as
would seem to be necessary to reconcile the
Genital system standard measure throughout
the United States and Canada. rl5e-. '-


AS no definite plan had been settled upon
for holding the National Convention, it was
voted to place the communications on file.
Communications from the Secretary of the
Treasury and President of the Maine Central
Il Railroad Company were read and ordered to
be placed on file. sE (


That of the af tba
that the Department had reconsidersd the de-
csion of the 18th of October, 1866, in relation
to the freight on Merchandise from Canada,
thus anticipating the request of the Portland
Board of Trade. ft5l- ts4t se-e .zss
Y The communi aation from the President of
the Maine Central Railroad Company was in
relation to a request made by our merchants
that an carly train might be run to the city
from Winthrop or Waterville. The President
states that efforts have been made to obtain
land in Winthrop for the purpose of erecting
an en gine house and turn table, in order to put
such train upon the road. But their efforts
as yet have been unsuccessful.


A series OF resolutions in respect to the mem
ory Of the late Prof. A. D. Bache, of the U. s.
Coast Survey, were adopted, and on motion of
Mr.. Haskell, it was voted to defer any action
towards contributing money for suitable
monument to his memory until the subject
was better understood


-liss PORTLAND AND oGDENsBURG RAILROAD.


The President remarked that he noticed
present many Of the gentlemen who made an
excursion over the proposed route for rail-
road to Ogdensburg. He thought this one of
the most important objects for the interests of
Portland that had ewes been presented He
called upon Mayor Stevens to present his
views. "" w


The Mayor remarked that it was true he was
one of the party, and that he felt great inter-
est that the road to Ogdensburg should be built
But he was no talking man, and he would
leave it to others of the delegation to make
statements. mas ..-... =..tF -.-.s.y
sO Hon. John Lynch being called upon, said
that when he started on the excursion he very
much doubted whether the road could be built,
especially to the Maine boundary and through
New Hampshire and Vermont to connect at
Montpelier, or north Of that place. But after
Witnessing the spirit manifested in every place
the road would go through, and knowing what
pledges had been made towards it, he had
changed his mind as to the ability to build that
portion from the boundary line of the State.


Mr. Lynch stated what had been done in va
rious places in New Hampshire and Vermont
in aid of the road. As regarded that portion
in Maine, there must be solid subscription of
stock in this city, and the city itself would be
obliged to subscribe for stock instead of loan
ing its credit. r-i


He expatiated upon the value of this road to
the city, and spoke of the advantages of the
route, both for freight and passengers. The
route through the Notch of the White Noun
tans he now considered perfectly feasible and
it would be one of the most splendid routes in
the Union, running as it would three or four
hundred feet above the level of Saco river, and
on the side of some of the mountains.


q Hon. j. B. Brown said that like Mr.. Lynch,
he had been skeptical as to the feasibility of
this route, but his mind was now changed. He
was satisfied it could be built, and of its COM
mercial Importance to this city, no one could
have any idea. He then went into statement
of the advantages to be derived by opening
this direct route from Portland to Ogdensburg,
and mentioned some other projects that were
in inception, and which would be completed if
this road should be built which would be of
vast interest to the city of Portland.


.gsOf the prospects of large and increased
trade with Portland, should this road be built
there could not be the slightest doubt. OF the
value Of the stock of the road, there could be
no doubt, as parties stood ready to lease the
road as soon as built, and pay six per cent.
upon the cost. The business from Vermont
and Northern New Hampshire would be i'm
mense. 1t was road that should be built i'm
inediately, and our citizens should take hold
of it with vigor. lEtC. sJ;} 59!E50R~t


Gen. S. j. Anderson said that like the others
who had spoken, he started with great doubts
as to the feasibility of the measure, especially
as to the route through the Notch. In fact, he
believed it an impossibility. But his views had
entirely changed, and he had not the slightest
doubt the road conld be built and with not
exceedingly heavy grades. He also spoke of
the interest excited in all the towns in that
section of Maine and New Hampshire that the /
road should be built, and said that aid would
be obtained from every one of them, and the
business men had promised to make Portland
their market should the road be built. WCI


Gen. Anderson made some very interesting
statements regarding the trade of various
places which would be brought to this city. 1t
was for the interest of Portland that this road
should be built He had doubted its feasibility |
at first, but these doubts had all vanished, and

On the 1871 instant hearing was hsd In th,
ease Of ooBrsd Fsunes. master Of one Of III,
vessels engaged In the Potomac river trade, vhs
was charged By the harbor master with refusing
TO comply with his directions In matters within
the jurlsdistion Of bis ofhc. By objscting 10 move
bis vessel from the stream, where she lay 1t an.
chor. The evidence was heard BY Justice Tuck.
sr who reserved his Judgment until Wednesday
last at o'clock, p. N, whom he dismissed ths
case.


Tho question has been frequently discussed,
and there seems to be an impression among many
that the law gave the harbor master full and
entire control Of the wharvss and channel, and
that his judgment was the only rule; bat the
Justice, having reviewed tho law and those II al.
ludss to. decided differently In this case.
AT our request hs has furnished us copy Of
his opinion:


The law approved December 2s, 1868, ""pro.
viding for the appointment Of o harbor master,
and for other purposes, has been understood BY
magistrates and . number Of legal gentlemen 70
authorize the imposition Of 6ns for refusal or
neglect to obey the directions Of tho harbor mas.
ter In Just such cases % this. was lead 10 that
understanding. But . subsequent reading Of
tbs law satisfies me that II Is not the meaning Of
the Law. The sot only authorizes the hsrbor
master to superintend and enforce the execu.
tion Of all laws Of the District Of Columbia,
and Of all rules and regulations Of the corpo.
ration Of the city Of Washington, enacted, or
dainsd, and declared, or hereafter TO bs or.
dsined, enacted, or declared"" for certain pur.
poses specihedj and that 10 the extent Of the
officers Jurisdiction. Any refusal or neglect
to comply with the officers directions, author.
lied BY existing laws, 10 subject to the pen.
atty provided. II 10 not the duty Of q justice
Of the peace to impose q 6ne on the captain
or master OF ship or vessel simply because
he refuses 10 obey . direction Of the harbor
master. The direction must be given to secure
obedience TO some rule or regulation Of the cor.
porstion Of Washington or law Of tho District
Of Columbia.


The defendant in this case Is charged with ere,
fusing 10 move his vessel from the middle Of tho
channel, when obstructing the same, to the 10.
convenience Of vssssls entering the harbor, whom
requested to do so BY said harbor master""


The only law bearing upon this charge 10 tho
sct approved October 10, ls63-""to preserve the
navigation Of the Potomac and Auacostia rivers
and TO regulate the anchorage and mooring Of
vessels therein n'-(amending the act Of January
8, 1881, which provides ""that no vessel shall be
anchored within seventy Ave feet Of the front Of
any wharf, or moore to any other wharf 90 as TO
ob'truct more than one half Of tho dock between
any two wharves.""


The evidence Of the prosecution 10 substan.
TALLY that the vessel was lying directly across
the stream, without stating the distance from
the wharf 'front.' that the defendant was twice
directed to move II, promised once to do SO,
but finally refused, and did not during eight
hours that two vessels were inconvenienesd BY
his neglect


The defence show that the vessels were lying
one hundred and hfty to two hundred yards from
the wharf front, their anchors on the mud htts
that the two vessels that passed up came not
nearer than twenty. y.hvo yards Of either of those
at anchor, aud without difficulty; that IL is
customary for vessels to anchor there; and that
the reason Of the delay In moving was the alb.
sence Of the hands from the vessel.


II Is not proved that there has been q viola
tion Of tho act OF October 10. 1868, and as the
violation Of no other law Is alleged. IL Is very
clear to me that the defendant has not refused
to comply with tho directions Of the harbor mas
ter In matters ""ioithia The juyisdietion Of his
onice,"" and the case Is dismissed.

not to have a Society for the Prevention OF
Cruelty to Children. We had not recovered
from the sickening horrors of the case of the
Rev. Mr. Lindsay, who whipped his little son
to death because the child would not say his
prayers, when we were called upon the other day
to record a frightful instance of child torture
near Hackensack, n. j., which fortunately
came to the knowledge of the authorities be-
fore it had eliminated in downright murder.
A man and his wife, named Vanderbilt,
had taken an orphan child one Mary Ann
Farrell, from an asylum, for the purpose
of employing her as a servant. For about
eleven months the husband Knocked her about
with broOmstick, and the wife beat her with
an iron dipper They used to take her to the
cellar, strip her naked, tie her up by the wrists,
lash her with a hOrsewhip till the blood ran
down her limbs and then rub the raw flesh
with brine. She made her escape at last, and
was found one morning in the open fields, with
bare feet and legs, and wearing only single
thin undergarment, so saturated with blood
and filth that it had to be peeled from
her body like a scab. She appeared III
court with evidences of torture so pitiful upon
her person that stout men wept at the spccta-
Gle. Her Jaw had been broken; her hair had
been torn out by handfuls; her face was swollen
and defOuned her lips were cut open; her eyes
were blackencd and Scared; her whole body
was bruised and discolored. Little wonder that
the neighbors were with difficulty restrained
from wrealling Lynch-aw vengeance on the
authors Of the outrage.


The same day we reported the discovery OF
the dead body of an infant in an alley way i'll
this city. Its throat had been cut from ear to
ear the head was nearly severed from the
body there were three OF four cuts about the
neck, as if inflicted by the trembling, hurried
hand of woman. On that day also another
case of infanticide was added to the long list
which disgraccs our annual police calendar
An unknown woman was seen to drop
bundle in Twenty-sixth-st When opened it
was found to contain the murdered body OF
child, killed by strangulguV4.


One of the most shocking and inhuman child
murders that we ever read of occurred in the
early part of March in Warsaw, Indiana. An
abandoned woman named Hines apprentlced
her little boy, four years of age, to Mr.. ana
Mrs. Harl. They were to have kept the boy
until he was of age but the process of ""con-
""aueringr him which the man Harl Immediately
commenced was too severe for so tender a
baby, and death relieved him OF the
charge at the end of four weeks.
The day after his introduction to
his new home the poor infant was whipped
with ""a backsnakc whip"" because he did not
know his letters. He was scourged with
knotted wagon-whip, beaten with straps
knocked out of his chair for falling asleep,
bruised with clubs and bits of board until his
flesh was like a Jelly. One day the brute Harl
hanged him by the waist from a hook in the
wall, took off his shoes and stockings, and kim
died a fire under the soles of his feet.
When the flames began to die out, the
child's mother, who was present, was
compelled, with dreadful threats, to bring fresh
GOALS This torture lasted nearly half an hour.
Then the sufferer was taken down and tied TO
bed post. Spent with pain, he fell asleep;
for this crime he was locked up half naked for
two hours and half on cold February day
in cellar. AT night the executioner dipped
his head in a bucket of water and imprisoned
him again in the cellar. Then he turned him
ont of doors in lis shirt and trousers
After the burning, said Harls wife, i'll her
testimony in court, Il"" the child was not able to
run around as well as usual.h Sometimes, as
variation of the torture, the boy was hanged
up by the heels. One day. after he had been
whipped as usual, he seemed very poorly
he ""did not talk any,"" and at noon he was
put to bed. Early in the evening Harl sent
his wife TO her room. 1t was very late when
he followed her. 1--WE had no conversation
o. that night says Mrs Harl; 1.-THE child was
mot there in the morning. Mrs. Hines, the
mother, suspected foul play, and applied to
n magistrate. A search was made, and the
body of the poor boy was found in trunk at
the bottom of well. Harl made his escape,
but has since been captured. The women were
both arrested and tried as accOmpliceS in the
murder. They were acquitted, after an examl-
nation which seems to show that the mother,
who had done little or nothing TO prevent the
foul cruelty which had been exercised under
her very eyes, was the worst criminal OF the
three.


few days ago German carpenter was ar
rested in Chicago on a charge OF whipping his
daughter to death. The neighbOrs, alarmed at
the hOrrid outcries of the little sufferer sent
word 10 the police when the officers entered
the house the man and his wife were absent,
and the child was found dead, lying on her face
upon a bed. Her back was a mass of wounds;
her garments were saturated with blood; her
neck was purple with the marks of clutched
hand; the eyes were open, and the face was
distorted with agony.


These things are almost too Sickening FOR
comment. We used to believe that the whole
sale killing of children by slow torture was
refinement of wckcdness in which England led
the world but the records of the last year OF
two 20 far to transfer the bad preeminence to
nnrsnlves Mnrder hY the lash seems almost 10"

The trial of Surratt commenced to-day
The Criminal Court room vas crowded. Judge
Fisher took his seat at $50 u. m. when The
Court WAS formally opened. The jurors wers
called. all but four answering 10 their names
The prisoner was brought In az 1910. Ills
handouts were taken OIL, and he was assigned
a seat beside III, counsel. Surratt's face was
very palc. and he wears Il carewOrn aud trouG-
led look, but he iaintly SMILED occasionally rs
hc received nod of an acquaintance. After
sitting in the Courtroom Tor some time, he
engaged ina lively conversation with one OF
hi, counsel. Mr. Merrick. and was evidently
much amused, rs he laughed heartily.


Amer all the prcliminarics, Judge Fisher
asked If the counsel were ready TO proceed
Mr.. Bradley replied that the prisoner is ready
and had been ~ for weeks. District Attorney
Darlington said the prosecution were ready
to proceed. Before proceeding to empanel
the jury, however, the prosecuting counsel de-
sired 10 present motion 10 quash the whole
panel Of jurymcn rs not drawn according to
law.

..oi WASHINGTON, June III.


The Cabnetko-day held its first meeting
since the PresWents return, and the impor-
tunt question 80 fully canyassed of late, rela-
tive To the power of Military Commanders un-
der the reconstruction law. to remove State
and Municipal officials of state Governments
denominated by act Of Congress as provision
al. was among the matters which were dis
cusscd.


1t is understood that the Attorney General
holds that such removals can only be made
when the Stateor local officials are impeding
the enforcement of the reconstruction law,
and only then in the way provided by the said
act. They must first be arrested on that
charge, and tried in the manner provided i'll
the law. lfconyictcd and sentenced the Of
flee would, of course. become vacant. In other
words it is explained that the Military Com
manderS have no more power over these Of
ticials than they have over any other person
in the Military District which they command;
and that they must all be proceeded against
in some way whenever they are charged with
hindcrng the enforcement of the law. As
the logical consequence it is further main
tanned that these commanders have n0 legal
power under the reconstruction act to ill any
vacancy IN the State or Municipal office ere
ated in that way, any more than they haye
to ill the vacancy on the bench, occasioned
by the death of Judge holding his office un
der any of these State Governments. These
were the points made by the Attorney Cen
eral and other members of the Cabinet but as
the full opinion had not been written out no
final conclusion was arrived at. If this view
be adopted by the President. there is no doubt
but he will restore Gov. Wells to his place and
reinstate the displaced Mobile officials, tho gh
the Southern men here asking for such action
fear that it will not take place until after the
time for the summer session of Congress is
passed.

The President tonight stated in conversa-
ton that the complications and differences
arising under the Reconstruction act were
such that he was of the opinion that if Com
gre.s did not meet in July he should call an
extra session on the lst of August. This is
authentic, being derived from an authoritative
source.

of the topics ruminated and dwelt upon by
the down-country papers. We don't cntch
the idea from the captIon-though 1t is the
standard caption with the papers discussing
the subject 1t is thus: A school teacher
laws down a rule that each scholar shall
keep an account of his conduct, and make
written return at stated periods marking
his conduct, for instance, anywhere from
number one good to execrably wrdng--the
different degrees being easily denoted by
graduated scale of numbers. he reports,
also, on his progress in study. The teacher
leaves it a matter of conscience with the
Young American takes his own return
gives out his tickets and at the end OF the
term makes award, on this basis, OF the re-
wards of merit to the scholar who, sell
reported, stands highest.


1t strikes us as poor policy; and we haven't
seen Colhns-as Brother Lynch would say.
1t is a premium on brass, the facial variety
of which springs indigenous and spontaneous
throughout the land. and far in excess of the
demand. 1t is premium on lying which
art is too much encouraged already-without
having it belted and feruled il by the paid
knights of the birch.


Why, dear sirs, even in the good old times
when we went to school there were boys who
with such encouragement to their leading
propensities, would have died many years
ago more lamented for their virtues than
Peabody could buy up with all his money
more extolled for their learning, and rewards
of merit to prove it by, than Baron Won
Humboldt, or Agassiz, or Admirable erich
ton would ever have hoped to be, if they
could have made combination pool of all
their respective requirements and put it in
at posterity for only one chance. Why some
of those fellows-and their children beat
them badly-would have persuaded the world,
and shown ""merit"" certificates to prove it,
before they were eighteen years of age, that
they were the genuine original individual
who came into the world and died to save
sinners We don't believe in the ""self-
reporting"" system there's too much of it.

II observed that this argument is addressed 70
the whites of the South What will the Northern rep
resenatives Of the democratic party the colored
votersY Ay, there's the rub. They had just well
talk to the winds. And this consideration Is
element hitherto left out Of the calculation in
the proposal 70 resuscitate the great democratic
party. The Southern whites may be enabled to direct
the coored VOTE or at least combine with the coored
vote provided the colored people are not invited 70 get
the Northern democracy. Now quite satisfied
from what We have seen and heard very recently,
that It will be impossible TO rally the colored people To
the support OF any Northern democratic party. They
aege that the democratic party pro slavery party
chise in Connecticut New York. Ohio Michigan, New
Jersey-and that they regard IL eey In stand
up ngn between the Republican party aua ane pe%o 10
the southern whites in favor OF the Democratic
party-we are not sure that we shall control
them any way. Therefore the reorganization g te demo-
cratic party at the South implies necessarily the drdtony e
the line bceen the whites and the blacks That reorgdnt-a-
ton settles at the question 10 ho,c the colored u0e cU
be cas- arrays the tto0 races against each other at the
star. tl


Again There are plenty or ambitious and talented
demagogues among the whites that would avail them
selves of any preudices among the whites against the
democratic party to lead of fragment of the white
democracy. The South would fall into the hands OF
the republicans the bulk Of this party the South
sistng Of the solid C0l0red VOTE The result would be-
the democratic party would hold the power in
four Northern States have ty representatives in
Congress- and be as useless to the white people Of the
South now; rather mischevous, for intend
ing to help us, they have so far greatly damaged u.s.


What then? Then this:-wc must give the cold
shoulder TO the democratic overtures


What then? Must we go TO the republicans? No; We
must keep aloof from federal politics, or when repre-
sented in Congress- act as an independent body They
will all want votes


The first thing for the paclfcaton Of the country is
for the democratic party to dissolve: parties will
then FORM There are thousands u conservative in
the republican ranks who weary OF revolutionary
government who long for real peace between the





do so-without going to the democratic party. They
will not act with the democratic party. No matter why
mo matter whether right or wrong-wise or unwise-
they viii not do 1t.


For the present momcn. it is the policy of the South
Ito form no entanglng alliances"" We are not in the
Union and have nothing to do with federa politics We
are engaged IN carrying out measure in the enactment

day a couple of Indians, named Ned and
Jim called on All Toy and informed him
that they had discovered the whereabouts of
All Gap, the missing Chinaman, on Salt
Greek, near the Middletown road, and re
quested the payment cf the reward offered
for the discovery of the unfortunate Celestial.
Asking the Indians to accompany him, All
Toy called on Coroner Lynch. who empan
nelled jury and proceeded to the scene of
the murder for the purpose of holding an
inquest on the body. Arriving at the place
designated, investigation soon showed that
the Chnaman had been attacked and killed
on the road, and the body dragged some fifty
yards down the guch and partially buri d
under pile of loose gravel, and few limbs
from an old pine tree thrown over all. Upon
exhuming the body it was found that the
skull was crushed in, and deep knife
wound was visible in the right side of the

srR: The undersigned were appointed at our
meeting Of April 8 1857, committee to whom
was referred the following resolution: ..',.


'Resoived, That the Chair be, and he Is hereby,
directed TO appoint COMMITTEES Of three, whose
duty u shall be to prepare plan TO be laid be.
fore Congress for the colonization Of the Union
soldiers and sailors In the rebel states""


This resolution was introduced April l, 1867,
and laid on the table for one week. Al our
meeting Of April 8, 1867, Il consequently came
up % unfinished business. II was ordered that
IL be referred TO q committee Of three, and the
undersigued were duly appointed that com
mittee.


Your committee, therefore, Is not to prepare
the plan contemplated In the resolution, but to
report upon tho adoption or rejection Of the res
olutioni not how this colonization scheme shall
be carried out, but whether II is proper for the
Union to take any further steps In this matter.
Your committee 10 Of opinion that the present
inquiry, namely, whether the Union shall take
any further steps In this question, 10 altogether
Superauous, because the subject has been dis.
cussed at several meetings already, and was
unanimously endorsed BY the Union. But as
tho Union has seen proper to entrust 70 your
committee this fundamental inquiry, We will
consider II without reference to the previous
action Of tho Union.


Your COMMITTEES Is Of unanimous opinion that
the resolution should be adopted; that . com.
mittee should be appointed TO drsft . we'll.
dlgested plan for the practical execution Of tho
colonization contemplated, to be laid before
Congress as soon as It meets; that this should be
Aax Ill tknnk a.. L..
plan Is not Of easy accomplishment, and will
take considerable time, while II Is important to
have as prompt action as possible.
There are many reasons which could be offered
In favor Of colonization, but your committee can
only glance at few of them.


Most Of the late rebel States possess large
| quantities Of unoccupied land, containing soil
unsurpassed in fertility and located In q section
blessed with climate that IL favorable to health
and longevity; while at the same time 1t Is Of
easy access by means Of railroads and steam.
boats There are no long and weRrisome jour
| neys across plains, exposed to the barbarous at.
taoks Of the Indians, to be made to reach these
inviting places. There Is no doubt that the
Southern States would have long ago out.stripped
the Northern and Western States In all the ele.
ments of prosperity, II II had not been for the
institution Of slavery, which was so unfavorable
to free labor and freedom generally, and thereby
induced tho pioneer to 60 to some other section,
with not the same facilities but with institutions
dedicated to freedom.


Now that slavery has been removed, and that
the problem Of reconstruction can be considered
practically as solved, and now thst there is ade-
quatc protection to life and property in those
sections, through the instrumentaiity Of the mil.
itary reconstruction bill It Is expected that the
millions Of acres in the South, which are yet In
a primitive state of nature, will be occupiod BY
settlers and cultivated, thereby beneating them.
selves as we'll as the country.


These lands are subject to entry under the
homestead law that 10, bona fds settlers can So
cure, by occupation and the payment Of fee o
ten dollars, perpetual possession, without paying
for the land


The Southern States need loyal men-mer
from the North and West men Of energy and In
dustryi men who have been brought up undei
the humaniEing and liberaliEing ind auenees Of tn,
North. Tho South Is composed, at present, o.
the loyal blacks, 4 few loyal whites, and many
disloyal whites the most educated and refined
are generally the most disloyal, while the loya
there are generally without education. If
therefore, we could infuse into this mass a larg,
accession from the loyal and intelligent North
the work Of reconstruction would be more por
fectly done.


We know from experience what II Is to depend
on employment by the Government for support
We know how precarious such employment her
In Washington Is, especially for the soldier. W,
know how this Union has had TO struggle to 30
cure the employment Of soldiers, and we know
also with what little success We have been 70
wArded for our efforts. We know that to be thu


dependent Is slowly undermining our manhood
Would Il therefore not be better to look arount
for something else-something that will soour,
Independence as well as competence? Certainly
and this will do 1t. Let US encourage the ooloni
zatiou Of soldiers and sailors In the rebel States
and let US ask Congress to aid US in this goo,
work; but let US do something toward carrying
out this great object, whether Congross will al,
US or not.


In recommending the Union to take up th
work Of colonization, We do not wish to be under
stood that the Union is to give up its efforts /


obtain employment for soldiers here. These ei


forts, although oftener unsuccessful than other
wise, shall be continued so long as there Is com
rads out Of employment. But this win not pre-
won't, at the same time, colonization to be al


tempted as something better than dependent
' preoarious, and poorly. paid employment here
as something that will secure independence, CON
potency, home, while at the same time contrit
utng to the welfare Of our country by developin
its agricultural resources, and binding bithsrt


alienated section closely to the East, the North
and the West.


Our cities are ovorcrowded, which makes labo
cheap. That Is the reason why 1t Is so dificul


to obtain employment, and, whom obtained, Q
precarious and poorly paid On the other hand
the large tracts Of land South and West are lyin


idle for want OF this very labor that Is In exec,
In the cities. II we could eject a removal G
this surplus labor from the city to the South an
West, We would equaliIe labor and benefit o.
olasses.


, As this Is n work Of great magnitude, and as
refers to the common welfare Of our country,
is eminently proper to ask Congress for aid. Bt
we must present to Congress a well-digestet
d practical plan for the execution Of this grea
/, work The resolution under consideration Great,
q committee of three, whose duty 1t is to prepal
. such a plan.


8 We therefore recommend the adoption Of II
. resolution. We also recommend the followin
n amendment; A committee Of nino instead Of thrt
be appointed, to be charged with the duty calle
l. for In the original resolution also, to open an

Examination of Henry Williams


-Attempt TO Lynch Him.


AscurSEYvILLR, VI, July 29.-Henry
Williams, the fendish murderer Of Mr.. and
Mrs. Gowing, has undergone his examina-
tion, and, after barely escaping lynching
by q mob, 4 now safely confined in the
Rutland jail TO await his trial for murder
in the first degree. AT the conclusion oi
the examination, when the sheriff took the
prisoner from the hall, the excitement
among the crowd was intense, and there
was q general determination TO lynch him.
The officer, having succeeded in getting the
prisoner into the Ascutnett House, waited
nearly two hours for the exasperated crowd
to disperse; but finding they would not, he
obtained assistance and started to convey
the prisoner to the State prison, in Wind.
sor, to lodge him there for the night.
While going down the stairs Of the hotel
the crowd made O rush for the criminal
and the officer, but his assistants succeeded
in placing him in q team. After he was
In one OF the prominent citizens of the
town, relative Of the murdered victims,
threw rope with slip-noose over his
head but one Of the officers succeeded in
preventing its catching the neck Of the
murderer.


The team then started, followed by the
crowd, uttering cries Of Hang him,
Lynch the scoundrel,"" &c. The whip
was applied to the horses, and the officers
and murderer were soon out Of harms
way. The testimony against the prisoner
is strong, and there has as yet been moth.
ing offered to show that he Is other than
guilty Of the terrible double murder
charged upon him.


Miss Ella A. Gowing, q thirteen year
old daughter Of the murdered parties gave
in very clear statement OF the murder.
She said she heard some one call to her
father, who asked who was there. The
man replied that 1t was Mr.. Hitchcock,
and that the COWS were in the cornfeld.
Her father got up, dressed himself aud
went into the kitchen. She then heard q
loud voice in that direction, and in few
minutes man came into the bedroom,
where her mother was in bed, and she was
in trundle bed. Her mother asked the
man who he was, and was answered, ""Who
are your Impediately there was strug.
gle and the man then went out and all was
still. The girl was so frightened that she
covered up her head in the bedclothes and
remained perfectly still, which act proba-
bly, saved her life. She knew II was VIII
liams, for he worked for her father and she
knew his voice.


During the girls story the prisoner was
very much embarrassed, and when the
axe, clotted with blood, was brought into
the room, his head dropped instantane-
ously. His true name is said TO be Hiram
Miller, but he has recently gone by the
name OF Henry Williams,"

Senator Patterson TO tho audience who some

said that what We all did now for the children Of

without education thought was unlicensed lib.

Senator Patterson here drew q comparison Of
the different system Of education pursued In diff.
ferent countrios--for instance, America, Prussia
and China. We thought the Chinese system ab.
surd, and the Colsstials considered ours equally
as absurd. All systems ought to leave the mind
at liberty to think for ITSELF for therein lies the
true principles Of the liberty Of education. He

Mr.. Wallach took occasion to say that he was
not there as the representative Of the city, but
acted In behalf Of several liberal minded and be.
nevolent gentlemen, who furnished the where
withal for the purchase Of medals and premiums.
The means that had been heretofore devoted to
tho above purpose had been wisely appropriated
to extending the number OF schools. -.


The interval between tho distribution Of pre-
miums was enlivened by singing Of the pupils,
and also by music from portion of the Marine
band, which performed some Of Its most popular
airs


Mr. Rhees announced that during the two
days examination Of spelling one little mics had
not missed spelling single word, and for her
proficiency in this matter the committee deemed
l. Al n
jects-of some distinction, and had awarded to
Miss IueE Goodrich medal as an expert in cor.
rect spelling.


When little Miss Goodrich presented herself
before Mayor Wallach to receive the honorary
distinction Of the medal, she was greeted with
loud applause, and Mayor W. oOmplimented her
in few we'll. timed remarks.


Mr.. Walach was the recipient Of nearly

olusion of the interesting exercises the gentle.
men Of the press"" made q ""raid' upon the

WHAT SHALL BE Done WITH THEN p
As Detective McDsvitt was on his way to this
city, from New York, yesterday afternoon, he
saw three suspicious. looking colored men get on
the Washington train at the Relay House, nine
miles this side Of Baltimore lie kept an eye to
them until he arrived at the depot of this city,
where he met his partner, Mr.. Clarvoe, and they
arrested the three men and took thom TO police
headquarters. On tho way from the depot they
denied knowing each other. One said he was
on his way to Washington another. that he was
going to Lynchburg, Va and the other that be
had gone to the Relay House to attend pic.
mic, but found none there, At headquarters
they gave their names rs Andrew jackson, Jos. |
Dean and Ramona Bell. Notwithstanding the
fact that they denied all knowledge Of each
other, they had about them pretty much the
same kind Of articles, among which were two
sets Of high die and pennies two packs Of cards.
a razor counterfeit, broken bank and COnfed.
crate notes, &c also, q diary of their winnings
and expenses They arc all, undoubtedly, on
the confidence game, and will defraud all unsus.

reco gnized as an old offender of this city. Now
that the officers have them, what are they to do
with them They can be sent to the work.

loose In q few days, no doubt, and be ready to
resume their old tricks. We trust a law will yet
be enacted that will cover just such cases as this."

but received $50 and dozen shirts from Mr. ODay
of Buffalo for the prisoners from that city. lie wrote
TO Mr. ODay To call the attention OF the Fenian a,
thorties to the necessity of sending assistance ana
employing COUNSEL but nothing was Done
Ii was well known that any person
coming with assistance incurred no danger.
Bishop Lynch has no sympathy with tenlanlsm.

charge of the money sent ostentatiously and feS
sure that his refusal proceeded from reluctance 10 ald

believes the Fenian organization the best ever es-

given at the residence of Daniel Lynch, Esq,
on Sunday evening last, on the occasion of
the marriage of his daughter and Mr.. Ed,
ward Clunen, was one of the finest affairs of
that character ever witnessed in this place,
which of late is becoming celebrated for its
splendid wedding parties. A large assem-
blage of relatives, friends and invited guests
were present, and all appeared to feel highly
pleased and gratifed. All manner of good
things were supplied in profusion, and the
tables groaned under a weight of luxuries
sufficient to appease the appetites of
five times the number of those pres
ent. Of course the printer was not forgotten.
If the newly married couple make the voyage
of life as safely and prosperousy as we wish
them, they will indeed be happy.


We also acknowledge the receipt of a
bountful supply of wine and cake from Mr..
and Mrs. Thomas Greene. May their future
be cloudless, and peace, happiness and pros
perty attend them."

he has been talking that way.


You have no doubt heard that our fellow.
townsman, Jacob Neh, is in the field for the
office of Sheriff, and by the bye is foemau
not TO be sneezed at. His coming out will
make big crack in Bill Sexton's slate.


The rumor has been circulating bereabout
for a day or two that ""Soponaceous"" Yule is

young man lowering his aspirations some
coming down from Congress 10 Sheriff! If
Charley Tuttle has his say, he won't get

head Charley off, Dirty Poole's chances in
ali this slate making seems to be getting
beautifully less. From the political multer.

is bound 10 be some lame ducks among them

You read the filings that Boust and Phil.
Lynch, Of the Gold Hill News, are shying at
each other. 1t is rather rich. Everybody
in Placer county know, that they are both
political renegades, and that the almighty
dollar had more 10 do with their turning
Aboitionists, than any principle in which
they believed. Lynch, in bis News, Of the

stink of treason washed from behind bis ears
up TO as late as January, 1864! He dictate
to Union men who they should nomil
nate for Office! What brazen impudence""


Boust in his last issue OF the 1st inst,
retorts by saying Lynch was purchased by
Union men Of this county for the sum Of
three hundred dollars"" They are precious
pair of ducks, according to their own
showing:


Some Of the Radicals Of this Township
have become very suspicious of each other
and elimination and recriminaton is the
order Of the day. Dutch FIa;ers are down
on Gold Runers, and each locality is will
ing to make combination with Colfaxites
to clean out the other.

Orleans was witness thursday to two events
winch never were seen there before. The first
was committee Of citizens, headed by the
Mayor, welcoming to New Orleans an orator
OF known reputation in the North, and the
other was that of colored man riding in a
carriage at the expense of the CITY. The occa-
sion was the arrival of Hon. w D. Kelley,
member Of Congress from Pennsylvania, by
the New Orleans and Jackson railroad from
Memphis. On the arrival of the train, Judge
Kelley was met at the depot by Mayor Heath
and q large delegation OF prominent citizens,
and was thence escorted in an open carriage
followed by q train OF eight carriages, contain.
ing some members OF the Common Council
and the rest of the delegation, to the ST Charles
Hotel Among the crowd at the depot were
many colored people OF both sexes. At the
hotel the Mayor extended the hospitali-
speech, to which the latter replied with much
feeling, accepting the honor, and expressing
his qualification that man of his strong opin-
ion and impetuoslty Of speech was at last at
liberty to visit the now free city of New Or
leans, from which, by reason of his political
views, he had been hitherto excluded. Judge
HEST then welcomed Judge Kelley in the n anne
OF the citizens, and Rev. ID. ]. b Smith, a col
ored gentleman, in a few very eloquent words,
referring to Mr. kelley's early efforts In behalf
of his oppressed race, as well as to his con-
colored citizens, not only OF the city, but OF

Another Homicide.",,"


An affray occurred at Churntown, in this
county, on Saturday last, which terminated
in the death Of one of the parties. We give
the particulars as related to US by those who
heard the testimony adduced before the Cor
oner's jury.


On the day mentioned Capt. Hovey, and a
man named Smith, who was temporarily
stopping about Churntown, met in Barber q
Upton saloon. and engaged in game OF
cards to pass away the time, but there was
no betting on the game. After playing
awhile Smith accused Hoyey of cheating, and
declined to play any longer with him on that
account. I1oyey denied that he had cheated,
and Smith declared that he had done SO, with
considerable emphasis and passion. Hovey
then walked to the bar, and Upton, one OF
the proprietors of the saloon. ordered Smith
to shut up, and told him Hoyey would not
cheat him in playing game wherein there
was nothing whatever at stake. The inter-
ference of Upton appeared to enrage Smith,
and he used very offensive epithet towards
him. Hovey hearing the expression, and
supposing it applied to himself, turned from
the bar and struck Smith blow on the
mouth and nose, causing the blood to flow
quite freely. After slight scuffle the par
ties started out Of the saloon, as if they in
tended to fight in the street, Upton baving
informed them that he wanted no disturbance





in his house. On leaving the saloon Hovey
caught Smith by the hand and continued to
hold it, High words passed between them,
when Smith suddenly struck Hovey in the
breast with sheath knife. Hovey obtained
n rock, and showed disposition to continue
the difficulty, and when warned that Smith
had knife, replied that he had already cut
him, but that he was not much hurt Smith
then moved off, and Hovey's friends insisted
upon examining his wound. While they
were doing so he remarked that he felt faint,
and would like to lay down. He was then
carried into the saloon and laid down, and IN
few moments expired.


Coroner Lynch held an inquest upon the
body on Sunday, and the jury rendered
verdict that deceased came to his death by
knife wound inflicted by Smith, without any
Just cause or provoeation. Examination
showed that the knife had entered the body
of deceased at the lower point of the breast
bone, and ranging upward, passed entirely
through the heart. Smith fled to the hills,
and has not yet been arrested. Sheriff Hop
ping offers reward of $500 for such infor-
nation as will lead to his arrest."

killed on ShafFer's Gulch, branch of Middle
Creek, about mile and a half east of this
place, under the following circumstances, as
near as we have been able to learn:


1t appears that the Mexican was living
with a squaw at that place, and that she
owned several dogs, which had been commit
ting depredatons on some poultry belonging
to John Hoy, who resides in the same
neighborhood Hoy, in order to protect his
poultry from future depredations, went to
where the dogs were and commenced shoot
ing them, whereupon the squaw, and several
more of her tribe who were present, set up
great outcry, which soon broughtthe Mexican
to the scene. Hoy, who was the only white
man present, states that the Mexican ad-
vanced upon him with knife in his hand land
that be several times warned him to approach
no closer. The Mexican continued to ad-
vance until within a few feet of Hoy, who
fired his gun at him, when the man instantly
fell forward, dead. Hoy then came into
town and gave himself up to the authorities,
and had an examination before Justice Knox
which resulted in his acquittal.


Coroner Lynch, on being notified of the
occurrence. empannelled jury and repaired
to the scene Examination showed that
deceased was about thirty years of age, and
that his death resulted from gun shot
wound, the ball having entered the right side
of the breast, below the collar bone, and
ranging downward, passed out below the
fifth rib, making hole an inch and half in
diameter. The jury rendered a verdict that
deceased came to his death from the effects of
gunshot wound, inflicted by John Hoy, on
the 1st day of October, 1867."

that man named Cooper bad disappeared
from Whiskytown, and that fears were
entertained that he had met with foul play.
Search was made for the missing man
throughout the neighborhood to no purpose
Finally suspicion rested upon certain
dissolute character residing in the neighbor-
hood, and resort to Lynch law was strongly
talked of by some of the citizens. just at
the time the feeling was running highest the
missing man returned from protracted hunt
in Trinity Mountains, and Judge Lynch's
code Immediately fell into disrepute. 1t is
generally best to 90 slow in such cases."

A esterday morning at an
= early hour, one Of the most destructive torna.
does passed over this city ever known to have
occurred. There was but little admonition Of its
coming; rising quickly, II travelled with unpsr.
allslsd fury and completed Its work In most
summary mannsr-short, sharp, and decisive.
!, The previous day had been scorehingly hot, and
night was ushsrsd In warm and with but little
air stirring Toward tho mid Of night, the skies
assumed hssy hue, the stars grew dim and the
= atmosphere more oppressive. There were no
eindieations At midnight By the barometer In
Thompson's Drug Store, corner Of New York
avenue and Fifteenth streets, Of any material
change 10 the weather; nor did "" ""Aneroids' be.
longing to different gentlemen throughout the
city forstsll at that hour the approach Of any
storm--one "" ""Ansroid' that We have learned Of
about .. M, fell 2.l0ths. and the gentleman In
whose possession IL was, secured his house from
the danger Of any storm which might suddenly
arise. The lightning had been distinctly play.
ing In the Heavens long before midnight, and
with ths ushshng In Of . new day, 1t increased
In power and rapidity. The flashes were more
frequent and vivid and the muttsring thunder
indicated to those who heard 1.-THE slsepless
invalid, the wsyfarsr, the policeman on his beat
and the restlsrs slumbersr, that shower Of rain
at least was most surely ooming-none dreamed
Of the sudden blast which at three o'clock burst
upon Us. A fearful fash Of lightning accom-.
panied BY . heavy clap Of thunder, wore the
pioneers Of the storm. and with Its advent, mat
tss and things In and around the city changed
eonsidsrably. Houses were blown down, trees
Sprootsd, roofs carried away, shutters torn Of,
7fnd the sudden appearance Of night caps at the
windows TO close the latter were many and vari-
Gus. The storm lasted nearly IN hour, though
the rain which set In In its heighth continued
TIL soms time after the break Of day. An i'm
msnss amount Of damage has besn done in our
rntdst, and hava m douht that the dsstru,.
ton TO wheat crops lying In the track Of tho
storm has been great. Fortunately no loss Of
Slifs has attended the destruction Of property,
spd which fact we plsasursbly and gratefully
rsoord. There has, however, been much damage
done to buildings; some being completely blown
down, othsn unroofed and walls carried away
N one crumbling mass


Four brick houses on the corner Of Eleventh
and N strssts. north, had their roofs blown OF
One house on Fourteenth street, on the east side
below K, was blown completely down. One
.houss on Thirteenth and L streets, north, had
tho roof taken Of. One house on Eleventh
street, between K and L, north, had the roof
carried away The house ON Thirtesnth street,
No. sos, owned and occupied BY Mr.. olaEtoD,
clerk In Second Comptroller's ofice, had the roof
taken OF, and II was carried some distance south.
The rear wall also fell doing great damage to his
furniture.

and sx-souncilman, which was adjoining. II

Of Mr. Mslhorn's house though not hurt were
much frightened.

uian Institute grounds were also blown down, n
also through tho entire city shrubbery Of al
kinds suffered. The steamer HI Livingston
parted her moorings at the wharf and was blown
over on the fats, opposite the foot OF Sixth

The telegraph wires In tho city were more OF

over each other, and there were but few Of them
yesterday morning that were in working order


The west wall Of the Congregational church,
corner Of Tenth and @ Streets was blown down

i, through Maryiandi but the murky aspect of th'
sky, the vivid lightning and the leaden arehe
hanging to the heavy clouds away In the south

 1.-The sensation, this week, here has been the publication of Mr. Stewards dispatch to Sir Frederick Bruce on the subject of the two wretched men, Lynch and McMa- hon, who are lying under sentence of death at Toronto. I regret to say that the i'm precision 1t has made in England is one which all friends to both countries must deeply regret. It is regarded as distinct threat, and threat conveyed in an insult ing and spobbish form, to serve the politi- cal ends of the writer and pander to the bombastic instincts of your mob. 4 mod crate and Liberal paper, such as T7se Pal Mall Gazette, interprets it thus: ""We will enjoy the pleasure of dictating to you and giving you orders till it suits our conven- fence to take possession of your domin- ions., You are only tenants oll sufferance, and VIC will make you feel it"" This is their rendering of the dispatch, and own ! ~k r State permits himself to write, ""Good re- States that are adjacent to each other with daries,"" having regard to the circumstances of the case in Canada, one can only con- clude that he means bullying. We all know, as well as you, that the whole of our North American possessions or the main land may be over-run at any time long be- fore we could throw any force into the coun- try which could make head against your armies. We are also sensitively alive to the fact that the time of the year has just ar rived when it is virtually impossible for us to do anything for Canada, however press ing the need may be, and under these con- ditions we appreciate highly the taste of your Secretary's dispatch. I am very sor- ry for it, own. Notwithstanding much that has seemed to me petty, and unwor- thy of a man called to the front of free nation in such a crisis as yours, have al- ways tried to keep up the reYeect which I acquired for Mir. Seward wh1u reading the debates on Kansas questions years ago.

 The dastardly attempt on his life, associa- ted as it is with the martyfsm of your grand old President. reTyA those early feelings strongly, and it is with considers ble regret that am obliged fo throw them overheard. If his dispatch means nothing for us on this side, and isb intended for home consumption, and as $. bid for the Irish vote, it might have been ldone ct any rate in far better taste

 l FENIAN1sM

 | With respect to the merits of the ques- ton we are all agreed, so far as can judge, in the desire that every possible considera- ton should be given to the case of these prisoners. Our people revolt, as yours would do, against the execution of priest, and if McMahon can make out a shadow of case such as that set up for him, that he was in Canada on his own business, and only called in by the flibusters to do the duties of his office to wounded and dying men, he should be pardonsd freely. In like manner, if Lynch can adduce any proof that he was not 8 beligerent, but a spectator, sent by his employers to report on the fortunes of the invasion, though the case is far weaker than that of McMahon, no EngGshman would wish the sentence of death to be carried out But if Irishmen, whether citizens of the United States or not, will invade, not their own old coun- try, but province in which they have no traditional wrongs to avenge, and where the people have no sympathy with them, and in so doing shoot down volunteers who have turned out for the defense of their own hearths, they have nothing but short shrift to hope for from us. It would be l we'll if your politicians and journalists could find 1t in their hearts to treat this Irish question with more candor and hon. esty. can appreciate the temptation of a | bid for the Irish vote at your elections; but the real leaders should be proof against such temptation-and I confess that the tone of even the best Republicans on this 1 question is source of much humiliation 1 to your most firm friends here. Even in your own columns I see Ireland chased in the same category with Poland and other oppressed nations, and this without any proof or argument which would not have applied with at least as great weight to 1 your own Rebel States-for it all comes to this, even assuming your premises to be true: that considerable portion of the i people of Ireland wish to sever their con- nection with England. There is no distinc- ton whatever, in any part of the British Empire, between the Englishman and the Irishman. Wherever there is difference, it is in favor of the weaker people. They are less heavily taxed in their own island

 Every career in England Is perfectly open to them At our bar they share the high est prizes. Sir Hugh Cairns, who has just been promoted to the Chief-J Justiceship in our Court of Chancery, is an Irishman. There are three Irishmen among our com i mon law judges, and hosts of Irishmen are practicing with success at our bar, while there is no Englishman on the Irish bench, or, so far as I know, in practice at the Irish bar. In the church and the army the same rule holds, and in the medical profession there are many Irishmen our leading phy- sicians and surgeons. State education in Ireland is on far better footing than Ill England, and in this respect, but for the l internecine auarrels of the churches and sects, there would be nothing. more to be wished or fought for. The only real griev- ances which remain-the established church and the system of land tenures-wouid be abolished in session but for the opposition I of Irishmen themselves. And cannot but believe that all men among you who are"

wool is one of the branches Of industry
that has grown immensely during the last
four years in the United States. Both in
the quality of the wool and in the excel
lence of the articles made from it, the
manufacture of this country will compare
favorably with large portion of the for
eign importations, and It is reasonable to
expect that ere long we will be able to
rival the finest woollen fabrics produced
in Europe.


During the year 1856 the wool grown in
the United States amounted to l37, 900, 900
pounds. We have 1000 woollen mills,

A CURIOUS FROG STORY Mr. wager, hv-
ing near Mitchelfs Station, in Culpepper
county, relates some very curious facts about
remarkable frog. at has lived, he says,
many years with US, and is great favorte,
and the greatest curiosity Is its becoming so
remarkably tame. Jthad frequented our door
steps before our hall door some years before
my acqualntances commenced with 1t. My
father had admired it on account OF its life
size and color, and he visited it every evening,
when it would come forth at his summons, and
by constant feeding it would come to the can
die and look up as if expecting to he taken
and brought to the table and fed on insects of
all sorts. On presenting live insects, it fixes
its eyes intently and remains mOtlOnless TOR
while as if preparing for n strike, which Is an
instantaneous throwing Of its tongue to great
distance, upon which the insect sticks last to
the tip by glutenOus matter. l can say
how long my father had been acquainted with
it, from my earliest recollection he spoke OF
it as Old Tom the old frog. | have known
it for number of years. can answer for
| fifty-sevcn years. 1t makes it appearance
with warm weather and remains with us till
fall, appearing morning and evening to our
great amusement, having been trained to do
many things, such as lcaping, turning sumer-
saults, holding alternately by its feet and hands
to small rope, swinging and whlrlng alter
the manner Of a slack rope performer, march
ing erect on its hind legs; and at the word Of
command going through the manuel exercise.
1t seems perfectly good natured, and never
shows temper but it is dreadfuly afraid of a
cat, on whose appearance it will often leap
four feet from off the floor, with the utmost
precision, plump into the mouth Of a large
water pitcher, and thus secure safe retreat
Yet he is in no wise alarmed or disturbed by
the presence of dogs, of which we may have
many about the premises. They seem to re-
gard him as one of the household and pri-
vieged character. The Hon. Judge Taylor,
who will attest the above statement II ade by


Mr.. Wager, in speaking of the frog remarked:


="" 1t is certainly one hundred years old, and
though he may have been here before the In


dians lett the country, he may be even now


but in his Infancy."

The Colorada Miner thus chronicles fis


tiana in Colorado: Out of mere curiosi


ty, and led by that instinct that carries


local journalist into all sorts of places


in search of items, we on Monday last


attended the first prize fight that has ever


blessed CD our visuals. The mill came


off two and half miles above Denver


on the Golden City road. and the parties


were Pony"" Ward of Georgetown and


Shanessy of Denver. The Pony"" was


much more than a match for his antag-


onist in wind, endurance and activity


but the latter could put in the biggest


kind oflicks and would soon have knock


ed the Pony"" out of time had il not


been for his alert dodging. The Pony""
was first to tap the clarRt and would
have worn out his man by his superior
endurance and activity had is not been
for a foul which caused the referee
TO decide the battle in favor of Sha-
messy. Neither party was very much
punished but the Pony"" had decided
advantage in this respect. Another
match between the same parties is on
the tapis and Georgetown is spoken of
as the place for the fight.


Col. Heine and Professor Simonin are
visiting and lecturing in Colorado. Mr.
Whitney is also delivering lectures on
the Paris Exposition. The Register has
the following from his Introductory re
marks: Col. Heine said it was mis-
taken impression that he was foreign
er. When he first landed at the foot of
Chambers street he went to the city
Hall without changing his shirt and
took the first steps 20 secure citizenship.
For the last eighteen years he has been
attached to the Typographical Engin-
eer corps. When the war broke out he !
was in Yeddo, Japan, but in fifty-four
days had returned home and was at his |
post. He served with distinction during |
the war, commanding a regiment, then !
brigade, and in Sheridan's campaign |
in the Virginia valley acted as General |
OF division. At present he is attached |
to the Legation at Paris, from which |
he got leave of absence for ninety DAYS |
to visit Colorado. The idea only struck |
him and Prof Simonin to come here
about the middle of August, and they
have certainly lost no time.


A dispatch to the San Franciso Bee |
says: Thomas Byrne, who shot and |
killed Michael Gibbon, alias Welsh, in a |
saloon three weeks ago, was sent before |
the Grand Jury this morning on charge |
of murder. The suicide of A. NJ Chap |
pelle, the real estate agent, has created |
quite n sensation. He wrote letter to |
Geo. Y. Knox in which he declared that |
he felt that he was going insane, and
that he felt that he must kill himself or
become an inmate of the Insane Asylum.
He crossed to Oakland on Saturday
night on the 6f boat and when opposite
Goat Island jumped overheard and was
drowned. This morning Richard Rich
ardson, while serving a writ on a negro
at Oakland, was shot and instantly kill
ed. Richardson is a policeman, and the
negro had squatted on a piece of land
and refused to give it up. The Oak
landers have taken the negro and are
trying him by lynch law. Rumor has
Just come that he is to be hung at 2

The following is from the San Fran

from Healdsburg says that fearful
drama occurred on the day of the cleo

The particulars of which have been given
BY gentleman who has returned from

existed between two families of the
names of Coats and Frost. On the day
both families came to the

Immediately fired at and killed Frost.
The firing at once became general be-
ween the families, during which five of

wounded dangerously. while on the
ther hand Frost was killed and his SON

The Stanton schoolheuse for eolored chill
dren, in Annapolis, Md, was yesterday fired
by some villain who hoped to deprive the
colored people of the means Of edu eating their
children; and on last Monday evening a mum.
Der of men and boys attacked the house in
Georgetown, Della aware, where the teacher OF
colored school was boarding, with bricks
and clubs. threatening to burn it. She left
town next morning, fearing to continue her
school, as a number Of prominent citizens, to
whom che applied for protection, refu sed to
have anything to do with her for tear Of the
mob. These are only two of many such oc-
currences reported in the Border States, while
weseldom hear of such outrages further South.
Why Is this! The only inference which can
be fairly drawn is that in the excluded
States the military pre- vent similar outbreaks.
Thus It Is that over er-zealous champions of the
South are continually bringing discredit ON
their cause, and this Will continue to be tha
case until the great mass Of the people in the
Southern and Border States show not only
that they discountenance, but are able to re-.
press all lawlessness and violence directed
against any class Of the comm unity. 1t Is
Claimed that such outrages As these we hay
mentioned are condemned by respectable per.
sons OF all parties. We do not doubt it, but
something more is required Of these ""respecta-
BILE persons"" than a mere expression Of senti-
ment. Unless they have courage to protect
the weak against the strong, regardless OF the
consequences to themselves, personally
through mob violence, they cannot complain
if the Federal Government interposes the
military power for the protection Of such of
its citizens as are deprived of their rights OF
person and properly by the followers of
Judge Lynch. Mob law must, and will be
put down."

be said now to be In full operation. There Is
quite good display OF agricultural imple-
menus, &C, on the ground, and many more are
about being entered. The cattle. swine, poui-
Try. de-, is not all in, but droves of cattle g..
are near by under shelter, and will be on the
ground to-day in the sheds set apart for them
Ample accommodations have been made for
the exhibition of stock, and the track is in fine
order. Among the horses on the ground are
the following: q. m. Lucy, b. e. Long Legs,
and b. m Belle Of Baltimore; b. g. General
and b. m May Queen, &. e. 10. Gales, r. IN.
Polly Ann, G. g. Guernsey, b. &. Red Rover. z.
g Coldwater Billy, Gray Eagle, Maeoosler.
b. m. Bell OF Washington, b m. Josephine,
Brown George. Kingston, and Lady Kossuth


Ihe procession to the fair left the Natiopal
noon. There We're a number OF nvited guests
IN carriagesI among whom was Mr.. Jones'
Vice President OF the UnIted States Agricul-
tural Society. The fifth calvary band, the
holy hill band. and a number of rrotting horses
were In The proce ssion, which moved TO wards
the Presidents House by street, returning

PASSED TERoUGH SAPRLY.-A two o.hun-
dred ton vessel passed through the-northern
draws OF the railroad and long bridges this
morning, for Georgetown. taking the old chan
mel ecTosS the fats, and thence direct TO that
place The experiment was q successful one,
very much 10 the Crprise OF a great many per.
sons. who believed the attempt utterly i'm.
practicable, rs communication through this
passage had been suspended over twenty
years since. The impression has prevailed for
nurnDsr of years past that the water near
the northern shore and west of the long bridge
mas become more shallow every year. and
therefore this route has been abandoned, and
tie solpplng has made the circuit around the
southern shore. Now, however, il has been
ascertained that the reverse is the fact, and
In stead OF there being decrease OF water it
mas increased in depth-or, rather, a more
perfect channel has formed. This is an i'm.
portant discovery for our commerce, inasmuch
as vessels discharging cargoes at the w ash
lngton Wharves can cut off between four aud
hve miles TO Georgetown by avoiding the ne.
eessitv OF taking the southern channel Steps
VIII be soon taken TO resurvey the water
grounds.


FATAL ACCIDENT ON THE STREET RAIL

O'Clock, boy named Charles Green, bet ween
and years of age, son OF Mr.. Thomas Green.
letter carrier, residing on y street, near FIRST

by one of the cars of the Washington and
Georgetown Railroad running over him II
appears from statements made by persons near

braked up and had no horses attached, ana by
some means the brake was loosened and the
Cas- car sired re down me grade, when the boy

and literally crushing out his BRAIN. He was
OF course killed instantly. The body was i'm
mediately taken up-Sergeant Pierce and ON.
Ger Brewer and others assisting-and Dr.
Murder was called but could be Of no service
There are other rumors IN relation to The affair,
one OF which Is that The boy was thrown off
by the car running round the curve, and stiIl
another that at the time he was attempting TO
get on the car. The Coroner was Immediately
notified, and before the jury the facts will
come out.

nails.",,"The recent decision of the United
States Supreme Court, in the cases of
Milligan, Bowles md Horsey, has created
quite commotion among the law break
ers, who have been running riot over our
country for the past five years. The
points decided by the Court are - f


1st. That civilians cannot be tried BY
military tribunals where the United States
Courts are recognized and in operation.


I'd. That the military in the Southern
States have at present no control over the
civil authority.


Sd. That Congress has no power to
grant jurisdiction to the military Courts
over the civil Courts, where these latter
are in undisturbed operation. ,r,


On the first two points the Court were
unanimous. On the last the Court were
di, ded-the majority declaring that Con-
gress did not possess the power--the
mi ority the contrary but all agreeing
thai Congress had not exercised the
power, and therefore, as to all practical
results it is the same as if they did not
possess it. Thus at one blow, is all the
stuff we have had repeated during the
past five years by brainless parrots about
""war power"" military necessity"" &c.,
DC, swept away. Every person who has
been connected with the trial and punish
ment of civilians during the past five
years, where the civil courts were in
operation, is now liable to be indicted
and tried for murder, if they put to death
the victims of their ilegality. This is no
more than we told them at the time
There is nothing whatever now, to pre-
vent the arrest and indictment of Joe.
Holt, Gen. Hunter, Bingham, of Ohio,
and every other person connected with
the Court that tried the parties said to
have been part;ceps criminis with Booth
in killing Mr.. Lincoln. In the eyes of
the law they are all guilty of murder
They had no more right to try and hang
Mrs. Surratt, Payne and the others, than
mob. But so crazy, vindictiye and hell
ish were they and their frenzied follow
ers, at the time, that they rushed on, re-
gardless of all law, and even stood ready
to lynch any one who was not as insane
and deviish as themselves. 1t will not
be strange occurrence, if some of these
men do yet suffer the extreme penalty OF
the law.-Day Book .''' ~"

Forward or Downward-The Law Of Revo-
Iutions.


In revolutionary times the watchword is
forward or downward. Moderate men and
measures are overwhelmed by the rush of
events. ""He that wavereth is like wave of
the sea driven with the wind and tossed"" The
trimmer tacks this way and that in almost ludi-
crous distress, is finally foundered and sinks.
Only the strong grasp of some representative
of one extreme party or Of the other can seize
and hold the helm Popular reforms-that is
to say, reforms abridging the privileges of an
oligarchy and extending the liberties of the
people-have often been suggested or planned
and sometimes initiated by members Of the
very class which would suffer loss by them The
higher the rank of such persons the less illibe-
raj they are apt to be in their theories. But if
they overcome the restraint of their habits and
lingering prejudices SO far as to attempt q
practical application of their theories, these
same persons are alarmed at the violent explo-
sion which follows. They soon find, however,
that they haye coajarsd up spirit which win
not down at their bidding, and which either
ippsls chem hagpnA THAR original intentiens

accents q public opinion. Oaee Get in motion
the sIiheel viii, turn, and those who will NOT
revolye with it must let 60 or be crushed.


One OF the earliest ""appeals to the people""
was made by Lucius Junius Brutus, when he
exhibited to the Romans the bleeding corpse
Of Lucretia. Notwithstanding the affected in
sanity under which he masked his patriotic
sentiments he held an important msgistracy,
and although the expulsion Of the Tarquins
and the abolition Of royalty, which was the
consequence Of his appeal, was . purely patri-
clan revolution yielding no immediate advan-
tage 10 the great body OF the people, yet 1t
taught the people of later days how to drive
out tyrants and upset thrones. Thus ""the
liberty of Rome, at its starting point"" says
thoughtful historian, ""was in the leash Of the
patricians"" Valerius, the successor of Col
latinus as the colleague of Brutus, won the
surname of Publioola, the friend of the peo-
ple,"" and fairly inaugurated the long conflict
between the patricians and the plebeians by
proposing the laws which bore his name
restraining the consular power-the executive
Of that tme-and securing to the plebeians
right Of trial by their peers simi-
lar to that enjoyed by the patricians.
His brother, Marcus Vslerius, strenuously
supported the reasonable demand of the people
for redress of their grievances when they
were treated like slaves by their patrician
creditors. These illustrious brothers and many
who shared the liberal feelings of their own
class could trace their descent from the earliest
members of their order, while the naughty
and selfish old fogy who was their principal
opponent was Sabine and had changed his
name from Artus Clausus to Appius Clandius,
when he migrated TO Rome. His opposition
was unsuccessful, and after the passage Of
law to which the people asssnted, providing
tor Q single supreme magistrate, the Senate
ruled with some show Of Justice oubse-
quently, indeed, patricisn cruelty to plebeian
debtors was revived , but it provoked seces-
sion Of the plebeiau armies in the midst Of war;
No less than twenty thousand plebeian soldiers
marched out OF camp to hill on tie, river
Anio. where they were joined by vast multi
tudes Of their discontented brethren The
Senate discovered that the popular demands
must be complied with before they had time to
be increased. II was, therefore, compelled to
conclude with the seceders treaty which was
the Magma Charta Of the plebeians, and the hill
itself became, under the title of Mons Sacer, .
sacred landmark In the history of Roman
liberty. The valerian laws were restored to
their former efficacy, and Eve annual msgis-
trates, whose persons were declared to be
inyiolsble. were chosen to watch over the
rights Of the people.


After having gained what Is called personal
liberty, through the protection Of their tri-
bunes, the plebeians maintained with varying
fortunes long conflict with the patricians, in
order to win at first social and afterwards
political liberty. Coriolanus, still stronger
type than Appius Claudius Of the old fcgy patri-
clan. made the cruel proposal to the Senate
that the corn generously sent by . Sicilian
prince to Rome during famine should not be
distributed to the starving until the plebeans
had relinquished all the privileges which they
had acquired by their recent secession On
coming oat from the Senate after making
his detestable speech Coriolanus would have
been lynched by the mob, which was infuriated
bv the want Of food as well as thirst for liberty.
IL the tribunes had not interposed their autho-
rity. The latter cited him TO trial before the
tribunes. He retorted that they, had no right
| to sit In judgment on such as he; but
| the tribunes were resolute, and even the
Senate warned him that he must yield. He
was impeached, tried, convicted and con-
dewned 70 exile. spurlus Cassius, who pro,"

 lam done with this world my vcr, last wishes are ia regard only to my lmortal remains. which will soon b, freed from all pain, and in regard tc those who must survive mo. My phy, sician, Dr. Basch, will have my body brought to Vera Cruz.

 You will take measures, my dear Baron, so that Dr. Basch and my two servants, who take my body i'll care, may accompany tito Europe on one Of the two war vessels. Over there wish to be buried by my poor wife. If the news of my poor wife's death should not prove true, my body should be placed somewhere until the Elm press rejoina me in death. Have the goodness to see that the necessary or dcrs are forwarded 10 Capt. Groellcr.

 Have also the goodness to take meas ures so that the widow of my faithful companion in arms, Miramon, can go to Europe on one Of the war vessels. I reckon the more on the fulfillment of this request, as she is charged to re- main with my mother at Vienna.

 Iagain thank you from my heart for the trouble which you take on nay &C., count, and I remain your well wishing ME MAxlMII,AN, NJ. r.

The regular Fall session of the Suner;or
| Court OF the State of Delaware, in and for Kent
| County, commenced here yesterday afternoon


ana upon the opening Of the Court it imme,


ulately proceeded to business with Chief Jus-


LEe Lce ,Ullpln and associate Judges Wooten and


Wales on the bench.


;. The usual charge to the Grand jury was de-


llvered by the Chief Justice, after which that


DOdy retired to their chambers to consider the


INDUCEMENTS brought against various persons
when are prosecuted on the part of the State
Inc hrst case which came up for trial was


tnat OF the State as. Moses Rash, who was


charged with an assault and battery upon Sam
uel Derry (n). Derry was the main prosecut-
ing witness, and on his taking the stand. Hon


Jos L. Comegys, the counsel for the defend.


ant arose and objected to the admission of his


testimony, on the ground that any acts nassod
Dy Congress which in any wise conficted with


the internal affairs of the States were snerins


Vi uh""arranted usurpatlons of power, and not


guaranteed to Congress by the Constitution =


Chet Justice Gilpin, in indecidng the point rails
ed by Mr.: COmegys, said that as the law stood


10 TINS State colored persons who alone. in


the absence OF white witnesses, saw an unlawful
act committed could testify in ourcourts, and even
where IhG main prosecuting witness was a negro


ne was allowed to give his testimony: but wbile
ne believed it would be to the interest,"" ofthe nco.
pie OF this State, both white and colored that onr
state law IN regard to the admission of testi


mony should be changed so as to allow them
In thlS respect to appear in Court equally with
the whites, yet he seriously doubted the power
OF Congress to pass laws which will conflict with
the already established laws of the State. This
decision Is one OF interest, for if it be acknow-
ledged' as Constitutional La,c, all simple enact


lnehts such as the Civil Rights Bill, unless
they atfnrmar1c ho
Amendments, are thus rendered null and void


Ills decision was cOncurred in by Judge Woot.
en-, but Judge Wales differed from the rest ot
the Court, and held that Congress had deera-
TED to 1t by the constitution such n 1av


i ne prosecutors testimony was admitted and
the jury found Rash to be guilty. The Court
sentenced Sc him to pay fine of 81 and costs
II ne second case was the State as. Jonathan
Williams, charged with cutting timber ON the
iahds OF Elizabeth Lambdin. The accused was
10ullu R guilty but has not yet been sentenced.
G6raper Tor State and Ridgely for defendant
0Cate u.s. John Spencer, (n.) charged with lar
cen GGe3ny OF horse, was next tried, but acquitted
Inc other and last case tried to-day was that
OF the State as. Stephen White, for nlucking
,nl Indlan corn from the field of Stephen Minner |
he Jury Is now considering it, but have not
yet returned with verdict Draper prosecu- |
TED Tor State and Massey defended the accused |
=, 1he criminal business will scarcely be got
through with tomorrow. Several cases from
your immediate vicinity have yet to be tried,
and among. them are those of the negro girl,
formerly living with Mr.. Collins, near Leipsic,
who is charged with arson, in burning the barn
which it is supposed caused the lynchng in
the case OF the negro, which you remember
took place some months since. The grand iurv
have that case of lynching in hand, and Attor-
ney General Moore is determined to spare no
trouble to ferret out and bring to Justice the
perpetrators of that most wanton outrage
The case of Joseph Hugg, for keeping dis
orderly house will come up tomorrow, as will
llso9 that of j. w. Thomas, for selling LIQUOR

New \ orkers interested in the Maryland and
Delaware railroad, contemplate buildino a
branch road connecting with the main stem ot
Easton and running through Royal Oak, st
IMlchaels, and down along the baysile. From
iEaston to Oxford (the termination of the main
llne) Is about twelve miles, and from Easton
to say the Mineral Spring wharf on the bay
sShore-ls about the same distance. The Grade
from Easton along the bayside is better than
on the line to Oxford, and hence a railroad
may ,, be very cheaply constructed NJ

entered under his chiu. The wound was most
horrible one, slckening to the sight. the whole
lower part of the face having been blown away.
Strange to say, the shot did not kill him in !

one O'Clock, when he died.

Of the clique that defeated in the Union State
Conven ton, induced the belief that they had con

candidates in the field would seem TO confirm this
view of the situation. 1t is not altogether without
precedent, as will be seen by the following:


""The Pensacola Florida. Observer saws that the

sixty neg roes who claimed their share of the plum

have spirited the treasure away, and would have
lynched him but for the iaterposition of the Sheriff

idle negroes, discussing the great issue


So it is now in California. The State is filled
with gangs of idle politicians, ""diseusSing the
great issue of the millions of dollars that they
have lost by the defeat of their schemes just as the
darkies of Pensacola lost their treasure and Just
as the old Pennsy lvania farmer lost FIVE hundred
dollars 10y not raising corn enough Ordinarily the
defeat of such schemes occasion but little disap-
pontment as the attack IS generally renewed until
1t becomes successful; but in the present instance,
like Pensacola grave yard treasure. it appears to
have slipped from their grasp forever as according
TO their charges, the Triumphant clique will lay up
on the State ABOUT all that its backbone can sastain
III that line. Hence the great evaporation of the

Ito affair transpired before tho Chief Of tho 40.
counting Bureau Of ono Of the departmental

embarrassing mistakes have already occurred In

pcarod before tho official In question upon the

with her husband again, and asked the De-
partment to dismiss hin. which request, Il is
more than probable, ,.willb be granted. Mrs. E.
We are informed, has been notified that her

tory-Early'sA Account ofhis March
ON Washington.",,"Year Of the War"" the following account OF
his famous demonstration on the capital:


""The rapid marching, which had broken
down number OF the men who were bare
footed or weakened by previous exposure,
and had been left in the Valley and directed
to be collected at Winchester, and the lossIs
in killed and wounded at Harper's Ferry,
Maryland Heights and Monocacy, had re.
duced my infantry TO about eight thousand
muskets OF those remaining, very large
number were greatly exhausted by the last
two days marching, some having fallen by
sunstroke, and Was satisfied, when we ar
rived in front Of the Notifications, that not
more than otie-thitd Of my force could have
been carried into actioh. ! had about forty
pieces Of field artillery, of which the largest
were twelve-pounder Napoleons, besides
few pieces Of horse artillery with the cavalry.
McCausland reported the works on the
GEORGETOWN pike too strongly manned for
him to assault. We could not move TO the
right or the left without its being discovered
from q signal station on the top Of the Sol
diers' Home which overlooked the country,
and the enemy would have been enabled 10
move in his works to meet u.s.


Under the circumstances, TO have rushed
my men blindly against the fortifcations,
without understanding the nature Of things,
would have been worse than folly. IL we
had any friends in Washington, none Of them
came out 20 give US information, and this
satisfied me that the place was not unde-
Tended / knew that troops had arrived from
Grants army, for prisoners had been cap
tured from Ricketts, division Of the Sixth
corps at Monocacy. From Sharpsburg had
sent message to Mosby, by one OF his men,
requesting him to cross the Potomac below
Harper's Ferry, cut the railroad and tele-
graph and endeavor to find out the condition
Of things in Washington; but he had not
crossed the river, and had received no in
formation from him. A Northern paper
which was obtained gave the information that
Hunter, after moving up the Ohio river in
steamboats,, was passing over the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad and knew that he would
be at Harper's Ferry soon, aud Imboden had
done very little damage to the road west Of
Martinsburg.


After dark on the llth held consulta-
ton with Major Gems. Breckinridge, Rodes
Gordon and Ramseur, in which stated TO
them the danger Of remaining where we were
and the necessity of doing something imme-
diately as the probability was that the passes
Of the South Mountain and the fords Of the
Upper Potomac would soon be closed against
u.s. After interchanging views with them
being very reluctant to abandon the capture
of Washington, determined to make an as
sault on the enemy's works at daylight next
morning, unless some information should be
received before that time showing It's imprac
ticability, and so informed those officers
During the night a dispatch was received
from Gen. Bradley johnson, from near Bal
timore, informing me that he had received
information, from reliable source, that two
corps had arrived from Gen. Grants army,
and that his whole army was probably in
motion. This caused me to delay the attack
until could examine the works again, and,
as soon as it was light enough to see, rode
to the front and found the parapets lined
with troops j had, therefore, reluctantly to
give up all hopes Of capturing Washington
after had arrived in sight Of the dome Of
the Capitol, and given the Federal authori-
ties a terrible fright.


""Grant, in his report, says in regard to the
condition Of things when / moved toward
Washington: The garrisons Of Baltimore
and Washington were at this time made up
of heavy artillery regiments, hundred days
men, and detachments from the invalid corps
And, in regard to the force Of Wallace at
Monocacy, he says His force was not suf-
ficient to ensure success, but he fought the
enemy nevertheless, and although it resulted
in defeat to our arms, yet ii detained the
enemy and thereby served to enable Gen.
Wright to reach Washington with two divi.
sions Of the Sixth corps, and the advance of
the Nineteenth corps before him. Stanton
says in his report: Here lat Washington
they (we) were met by troops from the army
of the Potomac consisting Of the Sixth corps,
under Gen. Wright; part Of the Eighth
corps, under Gen. Gilmore, and part of the
Nineteenth corps, just arrived from New Or
leans, under Gen. Emory


Taking Grants statement Of the troops
which had arrived from his army as the most
reliable, they were sufficient to hold the
works against my troops, at least till others
could arrive. But in addition to those which
had already arrived, there were the detach-
ments from the Invalid Corps, called, be-
lieve, the Veteran Reserves, (of which was
informed there were about FIVE thousand,)
the heavy artillery regiments, the hundred
days men, and, l suppose, the part Of the
Eighth corps mentioned by Stanton. To all
these may be added the local troops or mi
litia, and the Government employees Some
of the Northern papers stated that between
Saturday and Monday could have entered
the city; but Saturday was fighting at Mo-
nocacy, thirty.fve miles from Washington, a
force which could not leave in my rear and
after disposing of that force and moving as
rapidly as it was possible for me to move, |
did not arrive in front of the Notifications
until afternoon on Monday, and then my
troops were exhausted, and It required time
to bring them up into line. had then made
march, over the circuitous route by Char
lottesvlle, Lynchburg, and Salem, down the
valley, and through the passes of the South
Mountain, which, notwithstanding the delays
in dealing with Hunters, Sigel's, and Wal
lace's forces, is, for its length and rapidity, l
believe, without q parallel in this or any
other modern war-the unopposed maraud-
ing excursion of the freebooter Sherman
through Georgia not excepted. My small
force had been thrown up to the very walls
of the Federal capital, north of river which
could not be forded at any point within forty
miles, and with a heavy force and South
Mountain in my rear, the passes through
which mountain could be held by small
number of troops.

lected that the Potomac is wide river, and
navigable to Washington for the largest ves-
sells, will cause the intelligent reader to won

pressiye The life and character of the deceased
| were portrayed in glowing terms, and the recital
Of his acts of kindness to his fellow-man and the
selfsacrifcing spirit with which hc discharged
all the duties Of life had an electric effect on all
present, and caused many, not intimate acquaint-
ances Of the deceased, to shed tears. The rev.
erend gentleman spoke of the redemption, and
impres ssed on all to prepare themselves that they
| might stand In purity before the bar of God,
whose love Of mankind caused Him to sacrifice
| His son that sinners might bc saved, At the
conclusion Of tho eloquent diyines discourse, tho
| relatives and friends gazed upon the features Of
the honored departed for the lust time.
The coffin was furnished by Mr.. Joseph F.
| Birch, undertaken and was OF highly polished
black walnut, with a massive breastplato Of solid
silver upon which was engraved the name Of the
| deceased, the date Of his BIRTH and the time of
his death. On each side of the coffin were three
elaborately wrought silver frosted and FURNISHED

to Heaven, and the lid was fastened with dia.
mond.shaped studs, also Of silver. The pail.

The custom Of walking to the grave Is Of Eng.
lish origin, and, we learn, Mr.. Fullalove, some
time previous to his death. expressed a desire
| that his friends would follow him TO tho grave In
that manner Mr., Fullalove was born In Lin
cOlnshire, England, in the year 1887, and was
brought up on a farm until tho age Of IA. when
he was apprenticed to tho tailoring business, At
which he served seven years lie thOn worked
as jOurneyman for few years, whom he mar
ried, and shortly afterwards came to this ooun'
try, taking up his residence with his young wife,
In Georgetown. Here he obtained employ at his
business, and shortly after opened merchant
tailoring establishment which he conducted for
many years, accumulatng. by perseverance and
strict integrity competency which enabled
him to retire. The house In which ho died has
been occupied by him ~ years, and during that
period he was never absent from home for u
longer space Of time than 40 hours, except once,
whom he visited England, previous to the war OF

TOWN ELECTIONS.


The elections in the various townships OF the east

Morris Bergen, Sussex, MiddeseX, Mercer, and War
rem Counties-wll be held on Monday next. Under
an opinion lately given by the AttOmey-GeneIal Of
the State il is understood that IN unlncorpoIated
towns the election will not be conducted under the
registry law but under the general law as heretofore
An erroneous impression prevails, however, tlat all
the provisions of the old law apply 70 township eec
and closing of the polls. as the sunset law Is sep
arate from the registry"" law, and requires that in
all elections the polls shall open at Il. n and close
at sunset.


In New brunswick the Republicans have nominated
Woodbridge Strong for Mayor. and the Democrats
present Senator from MiddeseX County. Mayor
Watson has been renominated by the Paterson Dem

BETTING ON BASE BALL.-The most curl
Gus and amusing Of the many base ball contost
that have occurred this year was that which tool
place at Chicago few days since. The Excel
sior Club, Of that city, which has been fondly
regarded by It's citiEens as the best in the coun
try, has heen fearfully beaten by the National
Of Washington. Ono Of our Western exchange
estimates that the Washington party won hun
dred thousand dollars. and that half as mucl
more was taken out Of the city by other betters
Tho Milwaukee WIsoonSin says that one Mil
waukian brought back two thousand dollars
another one thousand two hundred dollars, an,
others all the way from fifty to one thousan,
dollars. The Chicago people unwisely got In
rage, and made charges Of ""jockeying"" agains
the winning club but these accusations wer
soon abandoned, and clcau confession of defea
had to bo made. This match may be regarded
as tho elimination Of the base ball MANIA whicl
has been so rapidly on the increase during thu
past year.


real. ESTATE AGENCY.-By an announce
mont in another column It will be seen that Mr.
William Dixon and Mr.. Samuel Cross hav,
formed a 90. partnership as real estate agents, a
No. 81 Louisiana avenue. They will give par
ticular attention to the purchase and sale of rea
estate, the payment Of taxes, and the examina
ton Of tax titles. Both Of these gentlemen hay,
had many years experience in business connected
with real estate. Mr. Dixon, as the communit,
we'll knows has been our City Collector for sew
eral years past, and as such has had facilities t.
assist him In tho business In which ho is now en-
gagged. Mr.. Cross has had years Of experience
as a business man, lately holding tho positions o
Alderman and chief clerk in Mr.. Dixon's Office
To our friends, therefore, who desire the service
Of real estate agents, We recommend this firm q
being gentlemen Of strict integrity, and who vii
transact their business In such manner as Il
give them no cause to regret their selection.

PATENT 0FFIcE.-An examination of thu
work performed at the Patent Office shows tha
the number Of applications, at tho present rat,
Of increase, will reach 20, 900 during the prescn
year, and that patents are being issued at tn
rate Of nearly three hundred per week. Th
applications have increased during tho past fou
years on average of nearly 8, 900 per year, whil
the means Of facilitating business have not beel
added in proportionato ratio. Tho nscessit,
for keeping the records and papers in the Paten
Office building requires that room for tho in
creased force authorized by Congress to meet tn
demand shall be made by transferring the clerk
Of some of the other Departments to the Pos
Office Department. Arrangements for this NOV
will very soon be completed.

CLoTHING.-Married gentlemen are
probably not aware that they are the
owners, in the eye of the law, of the
clothing supposed to belong to their
wives. Such is the purport of decis-
ion rendered by the court OF appeals
of Virginia, on Friday last. The par
ticulars are thus reported in the Rich
mond Times: ""About a year since
woman, named Mary E. Hughes, stole
a lot of wearing apparel belonging to
married lady of Middlesex county,
The woman was arrested, and, alter
examination in the lowe court carried
before the Circuit Court of said county.
The counsel of this woman demanded
her discharge on this ground: That,
as she was charged with stealing
clothing belonging to Mrs, in
was illegal. as no married woman own
edsher clothing, it being the property
of her husband. The court refused
to discharge the accused, but found
her guilty, and sentenced her to inn
prisonment for larceny thus deciding
that married woman does own her
clothing. An appeal was taken, and
the case brought before the Court OF
Appeals Itwas argued last term, and


on Yesterday the decision was given
that the Judgment Of the lower court


should be reversed, thus showing that,
IN the opinion of this court, the hus-
band owns his wife's clothing. -""

for such certificates, Of which they could make The same
sc maj hcv now do of the compound inferred notes that
are held by them part Of their reserve.


Mr.. WILSON Rep Iowa. showed, IN The cdrse OF some
ntcrlocutory observations, that the eject OF adopting
the plan ~ the Committee would be to pay Il those banks
three four millions year in interest and relieving
them the extent of such certificates Of lH necessity Of
keeping lawful money for the redemption their notes

WAsuSGToN Thursday, Feb. 81, 1861


Tn the Senate to-day very little business was Trans
acted A few hours were spent in discussing plH 10
bridge the Mississippi at Clinton, Iowa. Whch was
finally passed The bill to transfer the Ihulau pu
reau no the War Department then came ap ahd WIFI
out taking any action on it, long Executive session
uas held after which the dinner recess was taken
Animmense number of nominations 10 olhce ""cio
disposed of in the Executive session.


The evening session in the Senate was occnpeu III
discussing the Indian Appropriation bill No conc'n-
sion was reached and the Senate adjourned ~ ''oo


The proceedings in the House to-day were devoted
mostly to financial matters and were of very I'M
portant and interesting character. The expansion
lists and cOntractionsts ont in full force, ana
fonght one another with great vigor. POhtlcs hau
nought to do with the debate, the Democrats All
being split MP and divided the question under us
oussion. The Western mon went sohdly for eXpan-
sion while the Middle States and Eastern men were
divided, but mostly for contraction. Mr.. Hooper
from the Committee Ways and Means, reported
IN obedience TO former resolution of the House,
bill to provide ways and means for the payment OF
the Compound Interest Notes, and to prevent II
further contraction of the currency. The first sec





ton authorizes and directs the Secretary OreceNe on
deposit Compound Interest Notes with accrued inter
est as temporary loan with interest al the rate OF
e65-1O0 per cent per annum principal ana interest 10
be pavabe on said demand said notes to constitute
mart of the reserve fund of the National Banks pro-
vded for by the act TO provide National currency
provided that not less than twOfifths of the entire
reserve of such banks shall consist of United States
Legal Tender currency and the amount of such tenn
abo rnpf ha hpVpn6
The second section prohibits the Secretary of the
Treasury from retiring or canceling United States
eurrencv notes known as greenbacks during the
current year. Mr. Hooper supported his bill III very
able speech. Stevens followed, and moved to strike
out the first section, and insert in heu thereof
The following: THAT the Secretary OF the
Treasury is hereby authorized and directed 10
redeem the compound interest with the accrued III
terest thereon and TO issue therefrOm United States
Iegel Tender notes. 1t was over this amendment of
Stevens that long wranging discussion on FINANCES
occurred between members. The banking members
had the floor, and the Western expansOnists and
Eastern contTactionists consumed over three hours
time in trying TO convince one another that each
was right and the other was wrong. Allison, Price
Randall Pa) Hill Ross, and Nblaek did the talking
for the expansion party, while they were opposed in
debate by Hooper, POmeTOy, Darling, Dodge, Rice,
Dawes, Dawson, Eldrdge and Boyer. AT one time
the debate got very spirited. Randall, an ultra Dem
ocrat was busily engaged speaking in favor of
6tevens's amendment, surrounded by large
number of Western Radicals and Democrats
who were prompting him. Opposite him was Hooper,
the center of large group of Eastern Radicals and
Democrats all of whom were opposed TO the Amend
ment. Politics were ignored, quite contrast with
the debate of the last ten days, while the Recon-
struction bill vas before the House. There was no
affiliation between Democrats and Republicans in
debate then Stevens's amendment was finally
adopted by the large vote of 70 to SO.
On the passage of the bill the Yeas were
IS and Nays 81. All the Western members voted
In the affirmative with the exception Of Blow

traotonists The second section of the bill the
Objectionable portion, and it was evident unless it
was stricken out the bill would fail. So the second
section stricken out by vote OF 80 to 95. The
BILL then consisting of eleven amendments for the
first section, was passed by a vote of % to 6S.

The slow and mOnOtOnOus consideration of the Tax
bill was continued in the evening session of the
House.

IMPORTANT CURRENCY RESOLUTION.


The House has been engaged in an exciting
series OF votes in relation to resolution of
instruction to the Committee of WAYS and
Means in relation to the contraction of the
currency. Mr.. Rice of Iowa commenced the
fight by resolution instructng the Commit
tee to bring in bill restricting the contrac-
ton to the amount hitherto authorized, -four
millions per month. This was voted down by
aconsiderable majority Mr.. Grinnel of the
same State introduced another resolution pre-
pared by Mr. Lawrence of Ohio, which in
structs the committee to bring in bill for
bidding the reduction during the present year
OF the U. S. notes commonly known as ""green-
backs"" This resolution was finally adopted
by some twelve or fifteen majority The e.-
feet OF this is easily seen. Whatever reduc-
ton of the currency is now made will have to
bein compound interest notes, and not in |
those bearing no interest. Of The former it
is charged that Mr.. McCulloch has redeemed |
comparatively few. They are nearly all in the
hands ofbankers and this may account for
the action Of the Secretary. The effect of this
vote, in defining the policy OF Congress will be
considerable. ..,L --.l-t.. 4 ruF ""


Your representative, Mr. Lynch introduced
two important measures on the same subject,
which were properly referred. One of the
bills provides that after the 1st of July,
all Treasury notes received at the Treasury
shall be destroyed, new notes being issued,
bearing no interest, and payable in coin on de-
mand after one year. The new notes thus is
sued are not to exceed the amount of
those now in circulation. They are to be legal
tender, except for payment of interest on the
public debt The Treasury is also authorized
toissue similar notes in payment of such por-
tiOns of the national debt as may fall due
and become payable before certain day in
1868. The Secretary is authorized to pur-
chase coin to redeem these notes when their
payment is demanded.


NOT APPOINTED.


/ learn that Col James Mann, reported to
have been appointed Special Treasury Agent,
has not yet been so appointed. Information
has been given to the Secretary which shows
him to be an improper person for the appoint
ment. 1t has been ""hung up' fol- further con-
sideration. ah Ha+s h
A BOOK ON THE SECRET sERvIcE-How IT


WAS SUPPRESSED.


The Judiciary Committee have had sum-
moned here, as witnesses on the charge pre-
sentel by Representative Ashley against the
President, Gen. Lafayette C. Baker, and the
Rev. Mr.. Headley, well known as a book
maker and author. Baker was Chief cf the
Secret Service during the war; He has been
residing at Lansing, Michigan, but for some
time past has been travelling, as is believed,
to keep out of the way OF such process.
The public reputation of Baker is too well
known to be more than alluded to. 1t is
supposed that he is in possession of informa-
ton of a damaging character against Mr..
Johnson. Time will develope this. Mr..
Headley is sent for to testify with relation to
work on the secret service which he has
been editing for Gen. Baker. 1 t9 ..


""Thereby hangs tale"" which I propose to
narrate as told to me. Some time last Sum-
mer it was reported that Baker was about to
| publish his memoirs, and had made arrange
ments with New York publisher to that
| end. few days afterwards another para
| graph started on its rounds, limiting that said
book had been in some way suppressed. OF
course there was nothing known as to the
truth Of this. 1t now appears that the Rev.
Mr.. Headley prepared for Baker volume OF
the foregoing character. The matter pro-
ceeded far enough for the work to get into
/ type. THs rl


By some unexplained means the proof
sheets OF the book were placed in the hands
of VIM. H. Seward. They were of course
read, and with what interest may be judged
| by the fact ESQ stated that the Secretary
| struck out 176 pages, and sent the remainder
back. What means were brought to bear is
not known, but Immediately after the type
was distributed, and the publishers refused to
/ go further with the work. raiis s1a


Mr.. Headey is directed to bring with him
all papers and data furnished him by Baker.
The publishers are also to be summoned.


1t will be remembered that Mr.. Scovil of
New Jersey was charged, at the time of an
election for Senator in place of Stockton,
with having made a bargain with the Presi-
dent to prevent an election, he, Scovil, then
holding the balancing vote in the State Sem
ate. Mr. ScOvil is to be summoned to give
his testimony on this subject. 1t Is believed
he will do so willingly. The object will be to
prove that Mr.. johnson sought to make cor
rupt bargain, by use of the executive patron
age in New Jersey. h. 5000 Ia NM. ~
As soon as the Colorado Veto is disposed
OF, the Senators elect will be summoned be.
fore the judiciary Committee, to testify to
the propositions reported as made by the
President to them, at the time of the first ve-
to Of the bill admitting Colorado as State.
| The propositions were to the effect that Il the
delegation elect would sustain the policy of
| the Executive, he would sign the bill Of adj
mission. lH


The Cabinet are reported to be unit in
opposition to impeachment, Mr.. Stanton be-
ing claimed as especially antagonistic and
frank in the expression of his feeling ~
l THE NAVAL ACADEMY. Er-


Maryland curses at loyalty are like
chickens coming home to roost This morn.
ing Gen. Schenck introduced a resolution di-
recting the Naval Committee to report as TO
the expedieney of removing the Naval Acad-
emy from Annapolis to some locality where
loyalty ruled, and the social influences about
the cadets would not be likely to warp them |
from right sentiments The resolution pass
ed by very decided majority, after having
elected several strong expressions in relation
70 the course OF affairs in Maryland.


The rebel reactionaries there seem to have
awakened at last to realization of the abyss
to which they are driving so rapidly. On
Saturday the Senate had motion before n
to reconsider the vote by which the bill was
passed ordering special election tor munici.

BIDDEroRD, Aug. 8, 1867.


Iclosed my letter last night with brief
mention of Mr.. W. E. Stevens's essay on Jour-
nalism AMI Mr.. Drisko's sketch of the history
OF newspaper enterprise in Washington coun-
ty. Mr.. Stevens gave us very clear and forci-
bic presentation of his idea of the office OF
journalist. He holds the opinion, which VIII
strike some people as very strange, that II is
the first duty of Journalist to tell the truth
as he sees it. He is to look with honest, steady
eyes into the maze of phenomena winch 1t is
his daily duty to record, and tell what he sees
there. He is neither to affect an impossible
and unmanly neutrality, nor to tie himself alb.
solntely to the chariot wheel of any sect, clique
or party; but with modest selfrespect to de-
clare the truth, even when the truth is least
palatable to his readers. Mr. Stevens made
another startling assertion. He says that
sensible readers do not look for the expression
or their own views to the minutest shade in the
newspapers for which they subscribe; they ex-
pect merely an agreement in essentials and
are willing to tolerate independence in nom
essentials. This again will appear to some
people to be very strange doctrine; but as Mr..
Stevens is privileged by the circumstances un-
der which his essay was delivered, forbear to
criticize his positions. In fact 1 am quite con-
tent to let them alone there is dangerous
plausbility about them which does not invite
attack. r aHsi..fa 4t l.a. .-r-.r.t.. s OIL a.


Mr.. Driskos contribution to the newspaper
history of the State showed much research
and labor. 1t will be published with the min
utes of the convention. The association is do
ing good work in this direction Last year
reports were presented from Hancock and
Knox counties; partial report has been pre-
sented for Oxford county by Mr.. N. T. True, to
whom the subject was recommitted; in a few
years We shall have materials for complete
history of newspaper enterprise in Maine.


'A After the adjournment there were two or
three more arrivals-Mr. Nash, Of the Hallow-
ell Gazette, Mr.. Mareellus Emery of Bangor
Democrat, Mr.. Frank Dingley o: the Lewis
ton Journal, and ''Toby Candor,"" who came up
smiling after his severe punishment in the ar
duous business of reporting the Bates and


Bowdoin commandments. The representa-


ton Of the State is now very nearly complete.


Of the. hospitality of the good people of Bid


deford and Saco, we have had generous eS-


perience. Last evening a social reception was
rendered to the fraternity at the Biddeford
House. There was no dancing, but there were
cards for the taciturn, and pleasant partners
for the talkative, and music for the musical
aud supper at half past 10 for all. 1t was an
exceedingly pleasant occasion Today we
have also been indebted to this obliging COM
munity for a dinner at Old Orchard beach. j
lio1he convention met according to adjournment
at O'clock this morning! The subject Of adj
yertising was still under consideration, and ON


motion Of Mr.. W. 1T. Wheeler, of Bangor, the
following resolution was, after discussion,


adopted:eolqsI 10 eaiI5af q ensAaja.


IL Resolvea, That this Association views with


strong disapprobation the publication of adj
vertisements designed to point out facilities for


causing or procuring abortions, by medicines


or otherwise; and that we will consider the
continuance OF such publication by any MEM
her OF the Association as not cOnsonant with
the welfare OF the community or the credit of
the newspaper fraternity. Yqs sotlit7es-s ada fi


The consideration of the best method of en-
ploying advertising agents was then resumed.
Remarks were made by Messrs. Rust of Bel
'""'o ~'SiooAA3 u A<CWlSbOl, OpfdGue
Rockland, Wheeler of Bangor, Homan, Stew
ems and Quinby of Augusta, Foster of Port
land, and others. Mr.. Pettengill of Boston.


was invited to address the convention and
spoke briefly of the injurious tendency of the
practice of some agents, of dividing commits
sions with advertisers, the tendency being of
course TO break down the scale of prices gene
rally. The result of the discussionis express
ed ip the following resolution, offered by Mr..
n. A. Foster, of Portland: byait hq terd


/, Resolued, That the Executive Committee Of
the Association be directed to proceed forth
with to employ some person or persons, in Bos-
ton, New York, Philadelphia and at such other
commercial points as they deem proper, to act
as aqvertlslng agents for the newspaper press
OF andaine, at reduced rates of commission; and
that when these arrangements are completed.
we Will allow no. commission to auy other
agent or person in the respective places where
such agencies have been established.


Ioi Ihe resolution was discussed at considerable
length, and as the hour for adjournment to Old
Orchard Beach had now arrived, the subject
was was laid on the table for further consideration
after dinner, at which time the resolution was
taken up and unanimously adopted. The gen.
eral tenor Of the remarks pointed unmistaka-
bly, to the employment of single agency at
the various points where it may be desirable

Carriages were now in readiness and the
procession set out for the beach, headed by
Dodworths Band in an open wagon and pre-
senting an appearance not widely differing
from the triumphal march of circus compa-
ny. The company reached the seaside at il,
and fhR
Joyment. The billiard rooms and bowling al
leys attracted their quota of visitors. Others
strolled on the magnificent beach and watched
the bathers in the surf Still others visited
the pleasant grove in the rear of the hotel A
few miserable men sat on the piazza and read
newspapers. The band took possession of the
music room, and played choice solos accompa-
med by the piano. The regular guests at the
beach number only about two hundred 1t
would be surprising thai so charming spot is
80 little irequented, if it were not accounted
for by the fact that no pains have been taken
to bring its attractions before the public.


Dinner was served at 8. The citizens of Bid
deford and Saco were, as before, our entertain
ers, and were present in large numbers
Among the invited guests were Hon. John
Lynch, of Portland, Judge Rice, of Augusta,
Hon. Marshall Pierce, of Saco, of the Cover
nors Council, Superintendent Walter Hatch,
of the Portland &, Kennebec Railroad. and
others. The divine blessing was asked by the
Rev. Mr. Balkan, of Lewiston. The famous
clam chowder of the beach fully justified its
and the other dishes were worthy
to follow the chowder. After dinner came
humorous poem from Mr.. David Barker, en-
titled my First Courtship."" Tho poem was
excellently conceived and was founded upon
close observation of country life and manners.
1t was received with roars of laughter The
regular toasts were then read by Mr.. Butler of
Biddeford, chairman of the committee of ar

To the Editor Of the Press: aa - .lIs'-I - 4.


The org ,nization which meets here to-day
has been formed during the present year. A
large number of ship owners and ship build
ers assembled at Augusta on the 3Oth of
last January, to take into consideration
the vlrious depressing influences which
have SO seriously affected the ship
ping interest of the country. The dis
cussion took a pretty wide range, but the
convention, composed of practical, business
men, wisely undertook to do but one thing at
a time. The most grievous exaction under
which our shipping was then suffering was
undoubtedly the duplication of the tonnage
duty in certain cases, contrary, no doubt to
the expectation of the trainers of the law but
required by the lettor. The brig L. Staples,
for example, launched in October or Novem-
ber, 1865, paid this duty of 80 cents ton,
amounting to about $110 on the 29th of De-
cember. In the first week of January, 1866,
within ten days after the first payment, the
same vessel cleared from Portland and on
taking out her papers was compelled to pay
the same tax again. This was by no means a
solitary instance. The instructions from the
Treasury Department were clear and expli-
cit. The letter of the law required this two
fold tax, and there was no remedy except by
legislation. The convention accordingly ad-
dressed a memorial to Congress, setting forth
the hardshipof this exaction, and asking for
relief and Hon. N. G. Hitchborn of Stockton
was appointed to present the matter to the
proper committees of the two Houses of Con-
gress. a sf q a





In April Mr.. Hichborn was ready to report.
and on the 10th of April meeting was held
at Portland to hear his report and take such
further action as might seem necessary or de-
sirable. Mr.. Hitchborn was able to state that
Congress had granted all the memorial asked,
and had provided that the tonnage duty should
be paid only once in three hundred and sixty
five days. So the first move had been entire
ly successful, and has unquestionably saved the
State OF Maine dtring the year more than ten
thousand dollars. The advantage of co-opera-
ton having been so signally illustrated, it was
natural that the convention should next pro-
vide for a permanent organization, which was
accordingly done under the name of the Maine
ShipoYners and Shipbuilders Association, and
that is the body which meets here to-day.


The special object of the present meeting is
to consider the best means of presenting to
Congress the facts respecting the operation of
the revenue laws as they affect the shpbuild-
ing interest Mr.. Lynch's bill, already before
Congress, provides the remedy which it is
thought will relieve the disadv antages under |
which our shipbuilders labor in their necessa-
nv competition with foreign builders. The du-
ties on imported materials and the taxes ON ar |
ticles of home manufacture not only enhance |
the prime cost of vessels but their valuation |
and subsequent taxation. Unless these bur-
lens are removed, it is impossible for our
builders to compete with foreign builders who
are not subject to such drawbacks. The case
is plain, but the object of the convention is to
make it SO plain, by illustrative facts and fig
ures drawn from actual experience, that Con-
Eress cannot help seeing the imperative neces
- y of doing something to save the commercial
iihin iinairnlne of the cou, try. Meetings have been
iieiu ireuo IN New York and Boston and shipowners
Ine:e are ready to cooperate with Maine in
and wise action.

of Five Forks by Sheridan and Warren on
the Both of April, were the critical events
which compelled the evacuation of Peters

At an early hour the people from the country began pouring in--by l2 o'clock there were perhaps more people in town than have been here since the war. At about l23 o'clock the crowd repaired to the grounds to witness the tilting; while a larce number did not enter the grounds, there was very respectable attendance; the fairest daughters of Prairie county were there to grace the occasion with their presence, and by their smiles lend en- couragement to their favorite knight. As soon as preliminaries were arranged, the Kniehts were brought before the Judges stand, and in the absence of Col. lledg- beth. who was to have been orator of the day; the order in which they were to ride was explained. to them by Col. Edwards, the Herald; they then retired and tilting began. The first in order-riding once through, and so on to the end. The fol- lowing is table of the names of Knights and the number of Rings taken
