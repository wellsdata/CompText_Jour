To Sumathi Madhure, feeling different just came with the territory in her new country. From the time she arrived in
Nashua, N.H., at age 20, the sense would wash over her on long drives to get to an Indian restaurant or while
pushing her cart around the grocery store.

"When I saw another brown person in the supermarket, it was so rare, I would just invite them to my home for
dinner," Madhure said with a chuckle. "Building a sense of place, building a community; it doesn't just happen. It
doesn't happen if you don't make the effort."

Four decades later, her adoptive country has changed. Now Madhure -- physical therapist, mother of two and
political dynamo in Nashua -- feels the small stream of her journey in America has flowed with many, many others
into a mighty river.

She and other immigrants and others who have roots in India and other parts of South Asia gathered in Chicago
this week for the Democratic National Convention -- many expressing elation at the ascension of Kamala Harris as
the party's presidential nominee.

"To think that somebody who looks like her, somebody of South Asian descent, will be, perhaps, the president, be
the most powerful person in the world," Madhure began, pausing to visualize the image. "That's just, it's ... well, it's
just beyond imagination."

Madhure and hundreds of other "Desis," as South Asians living abroad often refer to themselves, came together at
a community center before Monday's main convention session -- responding with enthusiasm as politicos with
similar roots described how their elections had marked a first for their own communities in Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona and other states.

"It doesn't matter which color and which race you are; you still have to prove you are capable and worthy of the
job," said Madhure, a delegate. "To me, Kamala has proven she is capable and she can handle this job. But she
needs to keep proving it."

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 5

The potential political breakthrough sits with particular joy for those with ancestry in South Asia -- India, Nepal,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and other nations squeezed between Asia and the Mideast.

Harris was born in Oakland to a Jamaican father, Donald Harris, a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford
University, and Shyamala Gopalan, an India-born academic who traveled to UC Berkeley to pursue a doctorate in
nutrition and endocrinology.

In a meeting with Black journalists last month, former President Trump suggested that his new Democratic
opponent had somehow been duplicitous, as he made the false assertion that she had identified as Indian
American for years, only to "turn Black" later in life.

Black and South Asian supporters of Harris rolled their eyes at the notion of a white man dictating the identity of his
multiracial opponent, calling it tone-deaf and racist. They didn't have to repeat what history clearly shows: that
Harris has identified for decades with both her Black and Indian roots.

"To try to put everyone into one specific box, saying that they can't have demographics and values that fit other
identities, that just doesn't make any sense," said Bianca Shah, 24, a Maryland resident and Indian American
attending the convention. "There is so much blending of races and ethnicities in our country."

"She's both Black and Indian American," said Shah, a healthcare consultant, pointing to multiple markers of Harris'
Indian heritage, starting with her middle name, Devi -- Sanskrit for goddess.

"And she had an immigrant mother, who took her to India multiple times and instilled values and traditions in her
that we all recognize," Shah said.

Harris explained in 2003 to Asian Week that being from two cultures seemed perfectly natural to her as a child of
California's East Bay.

"I grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community," she said. "All my friends were
Black, and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt
uncomfortable with my cultural background."

Her experience is becoming increasingly common in the U.S., particularly in diverse states such as California. With
the U.S. census making it easier in 2020 for people to identify multiple racial and ethnic ancestries, the number of
multiracial Americans blossomed to 33.8 million. That's 10.2% of the total population.

Regardless of which candidate wins the presidential contest, a daughter of the South Asian diaspora will be in the
new administration: The wife of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, Usha Chilukuri Vance, will become
second lady of the United States if the Republicans win. Usha Vance grew up in San Diego, the daughter of two
academics who emigrated from India.

"Whether it's Kamala Harris, whether it's Usha Vance ... there's a pride that the community has arrived in the
mainstream of American politics," said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont), who represents one of California's most
heavily Indian American districts.

(Other Indian Americans also campaigned for president this election cycle: former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley
and Vivek Ramaswamy, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur, vied for the GOP nomination.)

There were fewer than 50 Indian and Asian Americans in elected office nationwide in 2016, according to Chintan
Patel, executive director of the Indian American Impact Fund. By 2024, that number had increased to more than
300.

Congress already has five members with South Asian roots -- Khanna and fellow California Democrat Ami Bera of
Elk Grove, Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.).

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 5
     Harris' fellow 'Desis' thrilled Those with South Asian roots add to Democratic convention buzz for nominee

And with a Democratic-tilting seat open, Virginia state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is likely to become the sixth
House member of South Asian descent.

A community once focused more on academia and professional life feels increasingly comfortable running for office,
said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a UC Riverside political science professor who studies Asian American voters. And,
unlike earlier generations, Indian American candidates are now running without Anglicizing their names.

"We are so far away from being a post-racial society," Ramakrishnan said, "but there does seem to be greater
social acceptability for Hindus and Indians with distinctive names to run for office."

Some South Asians have emblazoned a social media meme on T-shirts:

"In Sanskrit, Kamala means LOTUS. In America, Kamala means POTUS."

Ramakrishnan estimates there are about 2.1 million Indian American adults eligible to vote in the U.S. Some of that
population is concentrated in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.

Trump has won over some in the community with his warm embrace of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
whose profile is viewed by some as not unlike his onetime American counterpart -- authoritarians known for defying
political norms.

Ramaswamy is perhaps the highest-profile Indian American Trump surrogate. In campaign stops around the
country and on social media, he pummels Harris as a big-government liberal who would do damage to
"exceptionalism and merit."

Such views were not shared by the Indian Americans assembled for Harris in Chicago this week. Some of them,
like Harini Krishnan, got involved in politics at least in part out of disgust with the fury of Trump, particularly his
tirades against the evils he claims some immigrants bring to America.

Harris' late entry into the race unleashed a wave of support. A call of South Asian Women for Harris drew 10,000
participants. That, in turn, produced 500 new volunteers and $285,000 in donations, according to Krishnan, national
director of South Asians for Harris.

The Indian American Impact Fund was one of the first organizations to endorse Harris in the hours after President
Biden dropped out of the race.

The group launched desipresident.com to "mobilize and empower the South Asian American electorate to elect the
first Indian American President." Its motto: "Kamala ke Saath" (We're with Kamala).

In Chicago, journalists from South Asia have arrived to cover the convention and Harris, the woman who talks
fondly about vacations in Chennai, south of Mumbai, where she would go on long walks and receive treats from her
grandfather, a civil servant.

People in India have been making offerings to the gods and erecting small temples on Harris' behalf, said Lalit Jha,
chief U.S. correspondent for the Indian wire service PT1.

"People there are watching all this closely. They are excited about it," Jha said.

Shah, of Maryland, recalls the fervent phone call she received from her "Ba" -- her Indian-born grandmother, who
now lives in the U.S. -- on the night the news reported Harris had become the Democratic nominee: "She said,
'Kamala -- that was my mother's name! Can you believe it?' "

It's the first national convention for Deepa Sharma, a lawyer for small cities in the Bay Area. The California delegate
said she felt a bond with Harris in part because the candidate knew her parents' Indian restaurant in San
Francisco. And Sharma attended the same law school -- now known as UC Law of San Francisco -- as the
Democratic nominee.

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 5

Sharma said she remains anxious about a possible Trump victory. But the 36-year-old from Lafayette, Calif., said
she feels hopeful in a way that takes her back to the first presidential election she voted in.

"This may sound corny, but in 2008 with Obama, I had that sense of hope," Sharma said. "Now, I am excited again
-- to be able to organize around a sense of hope ... and to feel that I am for something and not just against
something."

Indian Americans are now the largest and most politically active group among Asian Americans. Among their
recent milestones: Vice President Kamala Harris, two G.O.P. presidential candidates — and a possible second
lady.

When Senator JD Vance became Donald J. Trump’s running mate this week on the Republican presidential ticket, it
also marked the first time that an Indian American and practicing Hindu, Usha Vance, stood to become a vice-
presidential spouse.

That cemented a remarkable reality: at the current moment, a woman of Indian descent will either serve another
term in the White House or be the second lady.

It was the latest milestone for an Indian American community that has emerged as a political powerhouse over the
past decade. Kamala Harris in 2021 became the first person of Indian descent, as well as the first woman and
Black person, to be vice president. The 2024 presidential cycle is the first one to have featured two Indian
American candidates in Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.

And there are now five Indian American members of Congress and nearly 40 Indian Americans in state
legislatures — the highest number of any Asian origin group in the country, according to AAPI Data, an
organization that collects data about Asian Americans.

It comes alongside another first for Indian Americans: They recently surpassed Chinese Americans to become the
largest Asian group in the United States among people who identify with one country of origin, according to a
census report released last year. In 2020, nearly 4.4 million people identified as solely Indian. (Chinese people are
still the largest group when counting those who identify with multiple countries of origin.)

Most Indians came to the United States after 1965, when a new immigration law removed restrictions that had
excluded Asians, Africans and others from the country. The Indian population in the United States has spiked in
recent decades, in particular, as American companies in the booming technology sector have sought to hire large
numbers of software engineers and computer programmers, drawing some of India’s most-educated workers.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 4
                  Indian Americans Become a Political Force, Just as Usha Vance ’s Profile Rises

Among Asians in the United States, Indians are the wealthiest and most highly educated origin group on average.
And on almost every measure of political and civic engagement, Indian Americans rank at or near the top among
Asian groups, a fact that experts largely attribute to their roots in a country with a strong democratic tradition and
high usage of English.

“Indian Americans are a growing force in American politics,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder and executive
director of AAPI Data.

The population boom has been a recent phenomenon. When Ms. Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, arrived in
1958 to pursue a graduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley, she was one of only 12,000 Indian
immigrants living in the country.

Many Indians who immigrated after the 1965 immigration act came to pursue higher education. That law lifted
quotas by country of origin, which had favored Europeans. After completing their studies, many Indians found jobs
and were sponsored for legal permanent residency by their employers. Others were brought to the United States by
companies and institutions to perform high-skilled jobs.

Mrs. Vance’s father, Krish Chilukuri, is a mechanical engineer who studied at the Indian Institute of Technology, the
country’s most prestigious engineering university system. Her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, is a biologist and now
provost of a college at the University of California, San Diego.

They raised Mrs. Vance and her sister, Shreya, in Rancho Peñasquitos, an upper-middle-class suburb of San
Diego, speaking Telugu and English at home. The Chilukuris were part of a close-knit group of six families from
southern India. Many of the adults were engineers or educators. Mrs. Vance and her parents did not respond to
requests for an interview.

The families stuck together even as the Indian community in San Diego ballooned from around 200 families in the
mid-1980s to about 40,000 people today, mirroring the larger shift in the nation’s Indian population, according to
Rami Reddy Mutyala, chairman of Shri Mandir, a local Hindu temple that the Chilukuris occasionally attend.

The women were avid readers and would often gather to discuss novels, while the men traded tips for growing
tropical fruits like guavas and mangoes, said Ramesh Rao, a close family friend of the Chilukuris. “There was an
obsession to try to see if you can recreate the summertime experiences of India,” Mr. Rao said.

In the past two decades, the growing demand for tech workers has resulted in a new surge of skilled immigrants
from India. About 60 percent of Indians in the United States today arrived after 2000. In recent years, the number
of Indian migrants illegally crossing the southern border has also spiked. As of 2021, about 725,000 undocumented
Indian immigrants were in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center.

The growing diversity within the Indian diaspora — which includes different faiths, economic backgrounds and
levels of education — has led at times to divisions within the community over issues like caste bias and the Hindu
nationalist politics of Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India.

All the while, the community has deepened its engagement with American politics.

Like many first-generation immigrants, the Chilukuris have not been especially vocal about politics, five family
friends said. But like most Indian Americans, Mrs. Vance’s parents are Democrats, according to recent voter
registration records. In 2017, Lakshmi Chilukuri was also one of more than 2,300 California professors who signed
an open letter to Mr. Trump urging him not to withdraw from the Paris accords on climate change.

Since at least 2008, Indian Americans, who have the highest voter turnout rates among Asian groups in
presidential elections, have been a reliably Democratic voting bloc. They have long seen the party as more tolerant
of different faiths and ethnicities, and more supportive of safety net policies they valued in India, Mr. Ramakrishnan
said. Over the years, the Democratic Party has also invested considerable resources in trying to appeal to Asian
American voters.

                                                                                                            Page 3 of 4

But Indian American support for President Biden has declined, and more Indian Americans are identifying as
independents, according to the Asian American Voter Survey released this month.

If Mr. Biden leaves the 2024 race, Ms. Harris would be his likeliest replacement, which would give Indian
Americans their first presidential nominee.

Some Republican leaders see an opportunity to make inroads on issues like family, education and immigration. And
even as the Republican Party has emphasized its ties to Christianity, some party leaders have tried to appeal to
people of other faiths.

Until recently, it was rare to see prominent Indian Americans in the Republican Party who were not Christian.
Bobby Jindal, a Louisiana Republican who ran for president in the 2016 cycle, was raised Hindu but has described
himself as an “evangelical Catholic.” Ms. Haley, another high-profile Republican, was raised Sikh and later
converted to Christianity.

But in an interview last month with Fox and Friends, Mrs. Vance spoke openly about the importance of her Hindu
faith in her upbringing. (Mr. Vance was raised Protestant and converted to Catholicism in 2019.) And Mr.
Ramaswamy, a classmate of the Vances at Yale Law School and a Trump acolyte, also spoke openly, though
carefully, about his Hindu faith on the presidential campaign trail.

Mrs. Vance’s elevated role could also help win over some Indian American voters and donors.

But the recent Asian American Voter Survey also showed that the drop in support for Mr. Biden among Indian
Americans has not corresponded with a meaningful uptick in support for Mr. Trump.

Miriam Lobo, a close friend of Mrs. Vance’s parents in San Diego, said that she was thrilled to see that Mrs. Vance,
whom she described as a “grounded” and “thoughtful” woman, now had a chance to become the nation’s second
lady. Ms. Lobo, an Indian American, has twice hosted Mr. Vance at her house for Christmas in recent years, she
said, and called him “simple folk” and “like one of us.”

But she did not mince words when it came to Mr. Vance’s running mate. “I don’t like Donald Trump,” she said. “I’ve
never liked him.” She then added, “I think,” and paused for a moment, before continuing: “I don’t like the way he
treats people.”

Mrs. Vance herself is something of a political enigma. She was a registered Democrat until at least 2014, according
to an online database that includes voter registration records. Even as her husband has gone from a “Never Trump”
critic to a fervent supporter of Mr. Trump, she has said little publicly or privately about her own politics, friends said.

At the Republican National Committee on Wednesday night, in her first high-profile appearance since Mr. Vance
became the Republican vice-presidential pick, Mrs. Vance spoke lovingly of her husband, describing him as a
devoted father and husband who had even learned how to cook Indian food for her mother despite being a “meat-
and-potatoes kind of guy.”

But two words were conspicuously missing from her speech: Donald Trump.

The former president falsely accused Vice President Kamala Harris of “only promoting” her Indian heritage, among
other inaccurate claims. Here’s a fact check.

Former President Donald J. Trump, in a combative appearance before the National Association of Black
Journalists, repeatedly disparaged Vice President Kamala Harris and the Black women interviewing him as he
made the case on Wednesday that Black voters should vote for him in November.

In a 30-minute appearance, Mr. Trump made false and exaggerated claims about Ms. Harris, overstated his role in
securing funding for historically Black colleges and universities and repeated his false assertion that he did more for
Black Americans than any president since Abraham Lincoln. He also rehashed several other inaccurate claims
about inflation, immigration and other topics that have become staples of his public appearances.

Here’s a fact check.

“I’ve known her a long time indirectly, not directly very much. And she was always of Indian heritage and she was
only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to
turn Black.”

False. Ms. Harris, the daughter of an Indian American mother and Jamaican father, has consistently identified as
Black in public life and long before she entered the national stage.

Ms. Harris told The Washington Post in 2019 that she had long been comfortable with her racial identity. The Post
reported that during her 2010 race for attorney general of California, some members of the Indian American
community in San Francisco had not known about Ms. Harris’s Indian heritage, and that in public office, Ms. Harris
had “tended to stress issues over her personal biography.”

But Ms. Harris never hid her biracial background during various campaigns. In her 2019 autobiography, “The Truths
We Hold,” Ms. Harris wrote that her family instilled “pride in our South Asian roots” in her and her sister, Maya, but
that “my mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters.”

“She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make
sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women,” Ms. Harris wrote in the book.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 4
                               Fact-Checking Trump’s Remarks on Race Fact Check

Ms. Harris joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, a sorority for Black women, at Howard University, a historically Black
university. She was also the president of the Black Law Students Association at the University of California
Hastings College of Law.

A 1999 Los Angeles Times article mentioning Ms. Harris, then an assistant district attorney in San Francisco,
referred to her as a “liberal African American” prosecutor, and a 2000 San Francisco Examiner article called Ms.
Harris a leader in the city’s Black community. She first ran for public office in 2002 for San Francisco district
attorney and, when she won her race, became the state’s first Black district attorney.

She appeared on a panel as an emerging leader in the Black community in a 2006 conference. And in a 2009
speech to a Los Angeles-area high school about Black history, Ms. Harris spoke of her personal history as
intertwined with that of the civil rights movement, alluding to how her parents “organized” in the streets during the
1960s.

When she ran for California attorney general in 2010, news outlets called Ms. Harris the “female Obama” and her
campaign website emphasized that she was the “first African American woman and first South Asian woman in
California to hold the office.”

Mr. Trump donated to Ms. Harris’s campaign after she became attorney general in 2011.

“She did not pass her bar exam. And she didn’t think she would pass it, and she didn’t think she was ever going to
pass it. And I don’t know what happened. Maybe she did pass it.”

This needs context. Ms. Harris failed California’s bar exam on her first attempt in July 1989, according to her
autobiography, and received a letter in November that she had failed, “to my utter devastation.” She wrote in the
book that she retook the exam in February 1990 and passed, and she was admitted to the bar in June 1990.

The California bar exam is among the hardest in the country. The July 1989 exam had a pass rate of 59.5 percent,
while the February 1990 exam had a pass rate of 45.9 percent.

“Historically Black colleges and universities were out of money. They were stone-cold broke. And I saved them. And
I gave them long-term financing.”

This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump is taking outsize credit. Historically Black colleges and universities were not “broke,”
but federal funding for H.B.C.U.s did run out in September 2019, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about
education policy. That December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and
made it permanent for a decade. Mr. Trump signed the legislation into law.

Democratic lawmakers and one H.B.C.U. president told Inside Higher Ed that Mr. Trump did little to secure the
funding besides bestowing his signature, though Republicans said his support was instrumental.

It is also worth noting that Mr. Trump did not request the increased funding that the schools received. He requested
$643 million in funding for H.B.C.U.s in the 2019 fiscal year and $626 million in the 2020 fiscal year, but
congressional appropriations topped $700 million in both years.

“I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.”

False. Historians would beg to differ. Among modern presidents, the most significant legislative achievements
arguably belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil
Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.

Mr. Trump tends to count among his accomplishments the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that made changes to
federal prison sentencing; the inclusion in the 2017 tax overhaul of the Opportunity Zones program, which offer a
tax break for investing in low-income communities and communities of color; funding for H.B.C.U.s; and low
unemployment rates for Black Americans.

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 4
                               Fact-Checking Trump’s Remarks on Race Fact Check

The First Step Act was the “the culmination of several years” of efforts and debate, according to the Congressional
Research Service, and it fell short of goals set by a more expansive overhaul proposed in 2015.

The Opportunity Zones tax break has “fueled a wave of developments financed by and built for the wealthiest
Americans,” The New York Times reported in 2019. A 2020 study found the tax break did little to spur job creation
in the “zones,” many of which were in predominantly Black communities.

The unemployment rate for Black Americans did reach 5.3 percent in September 2019, the lowest since the Bureau
of Labor Statistics began keeping records in 1972. But it fell even lower under President Biden, to 5.1 percent in
March 2023.

Mr. Trump also repeated many talking points that The New York Times has previously fact-checked:
    •   He claimed that the real inflation was “more than” the Consumer Price Index as it did not include interest
        rates. (The C.P.I. does not include interest rates for many reasons.)
    •   He claimed that many unauthorized immigrants were coming from prisons and mental institutions. (There is
        no evidence for this claim.)
    •   He misleadingly claimed that Mr. Biden’s classified documents case was “much worse” than his own. (The
        volume found in Mr. Biden’s case was much smaller. Also, Mr. Biden’s aides alerted officials when
        documents were discovered and cooperated, while Mr. Trump repeatedly defied requests.)
    •   He falsely claimed that Democrats were allowing abortion “after the baby is born.” (Infanticide is illegal in
        every state.)
    •   He misleadingly compared the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol to the Black Lives Matter protests in
        2020, asserting that “nothing happened” to protesters. (Thousands of those protesters were, in fact,
        arrested.)

Each night at the Democratic National Convention this week, the enthusiasm was palpable long before crowds
reached the gates. You could feel it in the tone of nearby conversations, the waves of laughter rolling from every
direction, the pace of the walk between the ride-share dropoff and the security checkpoint blocks away.

In June, Democrats wanted to defeat Donald Trump.

Now it's August, and Vice President Kamala Harris has changed what this election is about. She has voters looking
toward one another -- reminding us of our collective American values and shared humanity.

In 2020, anger and fear drove many of us to the polls. Harris is using a different source of energy, a source
embodied in a popular psalm often heard in the civil rights movement: "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
cometh in the morning."

Democrats showered each other with joy this week. And it wasn't about their party; it was about our country. Even
the heavily armed police officers and Secret Service agents, usually stoic, couldn't help but flash a smile inside the
house that Jordan built.

"America, the path that led me here in recent weeks, was no doubt ... unexpected," Harris said in her acceptance
speech Thursday. "But I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys."

Starting with the tea party movement, it felt as if progressives had ceded the idea of "love of country" to the angry
mob seething about the election of President Obama and passage of the Affordable Care Act: They were the flag
wavers who loudly called themselves patriots.

A shift began with the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.

Now Harris' campaign is challenging the right's claim to patriotism, love of country and -- with the sonic drive of
Beyonce's anthem -- the concept of freedom itself.

"This whole week has felt like a dream," said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. "I'm like,
'Am I going to wake up at some point and realize all of this has been a fantasy?' "

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3
                            Harris changed this election. This election changes America

Robinson grew up not far from where the convention was held. She went to Whitney Young High, the same school
as Michelle Obama. The former first lady electrified the crowd Tuesday. Robinson, the first Black woman to lead the
largest LGBTQ+ rights organization in the country, took the stage Wednesday.

"There's been chants of 'USA' in the conference halls," Robinson told me. "Normally I save all of my patriotism for
the Olympics, but I finally felt like when people were chanting that, that it wasn't a threat to me but a story that
included me. ... That is only possible because of what's happening right now, because of what Kamala Harris has
done."

In the early days after President Biden announced he was stepping out of the presidential election, there was
trepidation over whether America was ready for someone who looked like Harris to be president. Yes, Obama's
hope was aspirational. Yes, Hillary Clinton left 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling. But Harris? As president? For
many Americans, this was asking a lot.

To envision Harris as the first Black woman to be president, the first person of South Asian descent to be president
and the first person in an interracial marriage to be president ... that required voters to let go of what has always
been and embrace what may be. The answer to the question of whether America's ready for a president who isn't
white or male has since been answered by the rallying cry of "We're not going back."

"It's very, very powerful," Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) told me. "I was elected as the first South Asian to the
House on the same night Kamala Harris was the first South Asian to the Senate. When we are elected to these
positions, we help Black and brown women and other people see themselves. Something that may not have felt
possible suddenly feels possible."

That feeling can change suddenly, but it took decades to change what was possible. Harris accepted the
nomination 60 years to the day after Democrats refused to give Mississippi civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer --
who was pushing for Black voter representation -- a delegation seat at the national convention.

The Democratic president, Lyndon Johnson, had just signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. And yet the very next month, his running
mate Hubert Humphrey said of Hamer: "The president has said he will not let that illiterate woman speak on the
floor of the Democratic convention."

This is what Sam Cooke meant by "A Change Is Gonna Come."

It wasn't just about the laws on the books. The Civil War brought an end to slavery, but disenfranchising remained.
The change needed was one of the heart as well.

Cooke wrote the iconic song not long after he was refused a room in an all-white hotel in Louisiana. He released it
in 1964 -- a few months before Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the subsequent mistreatment of Hamer;
months before Shirley Chisholm, who would become the first Black congresswoman, won her first election; months
before Harris was born.

If those events seem random and disconnected, Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would tell you otherwise.

"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?" the vice president famously said last year, quoting her mother. "You
exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you."

When you are driven by fear and anger, seeing that connective tissue can become impossible. It's only through
compassion that we can see the ties that bind us. It's only through compassion that we can find the joy that
sustains.

"To hear Kamala speak of her Indian immigrant mother -- which reminds me of my own trailblazing mother who
moved a half-world away from her family in search of a different life -- is incredibly special," Versha Sharma, editor
in chief of Teen Vogue, told me. "We have been told our whole lives growing up as Americans that we can be and
do anything, but that's not been our reality as women of color. Slowly but surely things are starting to change."

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 3
                           Harris changed this election. This election changes America

That sentiment was echoed by many in and around the week's convention.

"This moment is literally hundreds of years in the making," said actress Poorna Jagannathan. "Set aside if you are a
Democrat, Republican or independent. Who we are as Americans is reflected in this ticket, and it surpasses politics.
This story could only happen in America."

Oh! Calcutta opens in Long Island City; Grand Brasserie fills Vanderbilt Hall with Parisian flair and more restaurant
news.

Opening

 Oh! Calcutta

 The louche collection of sketches by the critic Kenneth Tynan that opened Off Broadway in 1969 has inspired the
name of this new restaurant in Queens. Ruhel Amin, who has Indian restaurants in Harlem and Williamsburg,
presents dishes from Kolkata, including a Lake Market fish fry, vegetable cutlet, chapli kebab with minced lamb, and
kosha mangsho, a goat curry here. Workhorses like butter chicken, rogan josh and saag paneer are also on the
menu. The chefs are Sharmeen Rahman and Lisha Khondoka; both women have worked in Mr. Amin's other
restaurants.

 10-57 Jackson Avenue (50th Avenue), Long Island City, Queens, 718-532-0017, ohcalcuttanyc.com.

 Grand Brasserie

  Rick Blatstein, having sold OTG, his airport restaurant company with hundreds of outlets, continues to think big.
His new company, Vizz Group, has taken over the landmark Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal, previously
run by City Winery, and the adjacent dining room, formerly Cornelius. Grand Brasserie is an airy 400-seat
restaurant and bar, open during the terminal's hours. The Rockwell Group's design with Art Deco and Beaux Arts
accents and splashes of scarlet on tabletops and seats reflect the style of many Parisian brasseries and railway
terminals. (Opens Sunday)

 Souvlaki and gyro are the featured players in this Greek spot with counter service from the restaurateur Harry

 Mr. Bao

  An uncommon specialty has come to the heart of Midtown: abalone. Empress International, a South African food
company with a location in Old Tappan, N.J., imports the shellfish from South Africa. It has opened a duplex
restaurant, where the entire menu is devoted to abalone, often in Asian preparations. The mollusks are farm-raised
in an area just south of Cape Town. Abalone spring rolls, dumplings, skewers, stir-fried with Wagyu, fried rice, in
tom yum soup and cucumber salad ($9.95 to $39.99, with a 25 percent opening discount until the end of this month)
are some of the options. The company also plans restaurants in Chinatown and Long Island City, Queens. It's not
connected to the Mr. Bao chain of fast casual spots.

 110 West 40th Street, 929-302-3551, mrbaous.com.

 Joo OK

 A freight elevator whisks guests to the 16th floor of the building where the setting replicates a traditional Korean
home or hanok. Original industrial elements share the space with Korean art. The chef, Chang ho Shim, is opening
his New York restaurant for the prolific Hand Hospitality restaurant group. He seeks local ingredients for an upscale
menu in the works, which could include items like shrimp and vegetables with pine nut sauce, mollusks and pickled
quail egg with homemade perilla oil, and seafood with smoked soy sauce. (Tuesday, Sept. 3)

 22 West 32nd Street No. 16, 646-410-0332, joo-ok.com.

 Comida Corrida

  A plate of esquites or ceviche to temper the tequila perhaps? Now all it takes it heading upstairs from the bar, Only
Love Strangers, for home-style Mexican fare by the chef Alberto Gomez. The restaurant is a Mexican detour from
the Málà Project group, and its name refers to a Mexican set menu, here for $24 in addition to à la carte options.

 Japanese Listening Room & Speakeasy

  The second floor of the cavernous Zuma restaurant in Midtown has been turned into a reservations-only bar for
drinks like a cherry blossom gimlet and a fig leaf highball all featuring Suntory whiskies. Part of the space is a
Tokyo-style immersive listening room, also to reserve, with vinyl transmitted in high fidelity. The bar will also have a
top-flight audio system.

Puerto Rico, Peru and West Africa for sampling and purchase reflect the diversity of the area.

 On the Menu

 Zero Acre Farms

  To my wardrobe of media for frying and sautéing I've just added this new oil. And so have a number of chefs.
Made from fermented South American sugar cane, the oil has a high smoke point (485 degrees Fahrenheit), is
supposed to be less prone to oxidation than seed oils, with more stability so needs changing less often, enhancing
the bottom line. It's over 90 percent monounsaturated fat. It's neutral, quite light and doesn't produce greasy results.
Coqodaq in Manhattan uses it for the rafts of chicken it fries. Swizzler in Washington, D.C., Stoa Bar in San
Francisco and the private club 55 Seventy in Dallas are some other devotees. Its retail price of $29.99 for 16
ounces is not everyday, but it's a credible replacement for cold-pressed grapeseed oil.

CHICAGO - Republican 2024 presidential nominee Donald Trump in a controversial and combative appearance at
the National Association of Black Journalists Annual Convention took swipes on Wednesday at Vice President
Kamala Harris's racial identity — a move that comes as excitement swells for the Democratic contender.

"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to
be known as Black," the former president said of Harris, who is on track to face Trump as the Democratic
presidential nominee. “Is she Indian or is she Black? Because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden
she made a turn and she went she became a Black person.”

Trump sat for the 30-minute wide-ranging Q&A where he touched on a number of key issues important to the Black
community such as Sonya Massey, the Black woman who was fatally shot in the face by an Illinois sheriff's deputy
earlier this month, abortion access and why he chose Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.

The former president's appearance at NABJ sparked widespread backlash from some of those attending the
convention, expressing an array of concerns over Trump's comments about the Black community and attacks
against the media. For Trump, his remarks came at a critical inflection point of his 2024 campaign as Democrats
express increasing optimism about their chances of holding the White House in November with Harris atop the
ticket while the Republican continues pressing to court key constituencies, including Black voters. Throughout
Wednesday's conversation, Trump was met with some boos, groans and heckling.

Harris responded to Trump's NABJ interview Wednesday night during remarks in Houston. "It was the same old
show − the divisiveness and the disrespect," said Harris, who was addressing a historically Black sorority, Sigma
Gamma Rho Sorority, during its 60th Biennial Boule.

“And let me just say: The American people deserve better. The American people deserve a leader who tells the
truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader
who understands that our differences do not divide us," Harris said.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who was hosting a White House press briefing at the same time
as Trump’s Q&A, called Trump’s comments about Harris “repulsive.”

"Wow," Jean-Pierre said when she was read Trump’s comments on Harris’ race. "What you just read out to me is
repulsive. It's insulting. No one has the right to tell someone who they are, how they identify."

Trump accused Harris of being a “DEI” candidate, a talking point by many conservatives using the acronym for
diversity, equity and inclusion to disqualify people of color or women who ascend to positions of power and
influence.

Harris, who is Black and of South Asian descent, attended Howard University, a historically Black college. She is
also the first female vice president in U.S. history and the first Black woman to hold the office, too.

Shortly after the panel ended, Trump on Truth Social doubled down on his attack against Harris' racial identity,
sharing a video where she is cooking with actress Mindy Kaling, who is of South Asian decent. During the video,
Harris and Kaling talk about their Indian culture. Harris in the video told Kaling that she looks like "the entire one
half of my family."

Harris for President Communications Director Michael Tyler criticized Trump's comments as hostile and called on
the former president to accept a debate against Harris.

“Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency –
while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in," Tyler said in a
statement. "Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us."

Trump talks about Sonya Massey, but doesn't say her name. To gasps, says: 'you're talking about the
water, right?'

Trump was met with loud gasps from the room when he said he was unfamiliar with the details of the Massey
shooting, which sparked national outrage, saying he "doesn't know the exact case but I saw something," when
asked about the case.

“It didn't look good to me. It didn't look good to me,” Trump said. “You're talking with the water right?” Massey was
shot by police while she was holding boiling water.

Trump has previously said that police should get immunity from prosecution if he won the 2024 presidential race.
Semafor political reporter Kadia Goba asked whether the police officer in Massey’s case, Sangamon County
Sheriff's Deputy Sean P. Grayson, who is charged with her murder, would have immunity. Trump sidestepped the
question by talking about gun violence in Chicago.

When asked again by Goba, Trump said that he would help a person who “made an innocent mistake.”

“If I felt or if a group of people would feel that somebody was being unfairly prosecuted because the person did a
good job, maybe with a crime, or made a mistake, an innocent mistake…I would want to help that person,” Trump
said.

The former president also doubled down on comments he made accusing immigrants of stealing the jobs of Black
Americans.

“I will tell you that coming from the border are millions and millions of people that happen to be taking Black jobs,”
Trump said to gasps.

“What exactly is a ‘Black job,’ sir,” ABC News senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott quickly followed up.

“A Black job is anybody that has a job,” Trump responded, with laughter from the audience, before continuing to use
racist rhetoric against migrants coming to the United States.

Attacks on the media

Throughout the panel, Trump repeatedly attacked the press — and Scott in particular — for questions that were
being asked.

                                                                                                     Page 3 of 4

Trump in the very first question asked to him by Scott slammed her for asking why Black voters should support the
former president after his criticisms of the Black community.

“I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said to Scott. “Don't even say hello,
how are you? Are you with ABC because I think they're a fake news network.”

Scott, FOX News anchor Harris Faulkner and Semafor political reporter Goba lead the Q&A with Trump.

PolitiFact, a fact checking website, also led fact checking Trump in real time for NABJ.

Hundreds packed into a ballroom at the Hilton Chicago, which holds up to 1,100 seated, according to a hotel
employee. Dozens of reporters were outside of the hotel lining up to get into the event with the former president.

On Wednesday, NABJ announced that the organization was speaking with the Harris campaign to have her
appear for a Q&A with the organization sometime in September.

Harris on Wednesday is scheduled to be in Houston, Texas to deliver remarks for a political event. On Thursday,
she will deliver a eulogy for the late-Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee in Houston.

Trump throughout the presidential campaign has attempted to appeal to Black voters, a key voting bloc that
overwhelmingly supports the Democratic Party. But the former president is still unpopular with many Black voters.

President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 presidential campaign earlier this month, saw a drop in
enthusiasm from Black voters. But Harris, who is on the path to be the Democratic nominee, has reenergized
Democratic voters, including Black voters, since entering the race.

Ahead of his appearance, Trump on Truth Social criticized Harris for not speaking at the convention. The Harris
campaign in response to the former president’s conversation at the convention criticized his record and his
treatment of the press.

NABJ President Ken Lemon said Wednesday that the organization had been in talks with both the Democratic and
Republican parties since January, when Biden was still running to be the Democratic nominee. Biden had agreed to
speak when he was still a candidate.

At the White House, Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that Biden wouldn't be speaking at the NABJ convention because he
is “no longer a candidate.”

The administration understands it's important for Black Americans “to hear directly from this administration, and we
have done that — and not just Black Americans but all Americans,” Jean-Pierre said. “That is certainly something
that we will continue to do. And we take that very, very seriously.”

HARRISBURG, Pa. — Donald Trump thrives on attention like plants feed off sunlight.

So consider how disconcerting it must have been for our former president to watch our current vice president,
Kamala Harris, seize the national spotlight in the opening 10 days of her campaign for the White House.

Trump, left in the shadows, fumed as he was supplanted, whining that Fox News was airing Harris campaign rallies.
He’d rather be reviled than ignored.

That explains what happened Wednesday when Trump ranted through a racist tantrum while speaking to the
National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Chicago. Outside the protective bubble of cheering fans at
rallies, like the one he held Wednesday evening, and right-wing talking heads telling him how great he is, Trump
lashed out.

So predictable. He craved attention. He didn’t care how he got it, a common theme in both his appearances on
Wednesday.

Trump's racist remarks about Harris were just the first half of his day

Link to Image

Compare that with how Trump reveled in the adoration of his – overwhelmingly white – fans just a few hours later at
a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people cheered while he rambled through the same old stories
about immigration and crime and crime and immigration, with a warning of economic apocalypse here and there.

They didn’t care that Trump spoke in bumper-sticker slogans, never offering any detail about how he would reverse
everything that he sees as wrong about America. They didn't mind that Trump often sounded like he was still
challenging President Joe Biden, who dropped his bid for reelection on July 21 and endorsed Harris.

What a difference an audience makes.

Trump's racism on full display: At NABJ, Trump's blatant racism and disdain for talented Black women left me
appalled

Journalists at the NABJ convention had the temerity to accurately recount for Trump his past statements, smearing
and mocking Black politicians and journalists, and then asked him to explain why Black voters should support him.

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 4
                 Trump's racism at NABJ was revolting. It was all calculated for his MAGA fan base.

From the start, Trump was angry and off balance, lashing out at ABC News' Rachel Scott for asking a question “in
such a horrible manner.”

Trump, of course, didn't even try to answer the question. He was there for attention. Who cares about questions?

Trump used race-baiting with Black journalists to cater to his voting base

But Trump knows it’s not enough just to attack journalists. He’s done this long enough to understand that it takes
something absolutely outlandish to grab headlines while Harris is closing in on him in swing-state polling.

Race-baiting in front of a professional organization that represents people of a particular race was his go-to move.

He used NABJ’s platform to ridiculously claim that Harris, the first Black, South Asian and female vice president of
the United States, somehow previously presented as being of Indian heritage but then shifted to presenting as
Black.

“Is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump asked before adding this lie: “Because she was Indian all the way and then
all of a sudden she made a turn and she went ‒ she became a Black person.”

Harris’ father immigrated from Jamaica while her mother came to America from India. Her racial identity has been
well known and publicly established during her political career as a district attorney, California’s attorney general, in
the U.S. Senate and as vice president.

Trump clearly calculated that the revulsion his racism would evoke at NABJ was worth the delight his base would
find in it all.

Trump resorted to his usual lies about the Capitol riots when talking to his supporters

Link to Image

In Harrisburg, Trump again tried to rewrite the history of the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters
ransacked the U.S. Capitol while trying to overturn the election he had lost. "Peacefully and patriotically" was how
Trump put it.

He meandered through his recollection of the assassination attempt at his last Pennsylvania rally that left him with a
bloody ear while one man died and two more were injured. He toggled between amazement and amusement.

He went on the same weird tangents that are a staple now, talking about the movie character Hannibal Lecter and
then complaining about how weird many people find it that he keeps bringing that up at rallies.

Gen Z for Harris: Gen Z is mobilizing for Harris in ways we wouldn't for Biden. The momentum is palpable.

He lied about Democrats cheating in elections, unable to accept that he lost to Biden in 2020.

The crowd soaked it all up. Trump was back in his bubble, in a place where no one would dare ask him a question
he didn't want to hear or answer.

Trump made himself clear to his supporters and any voters still on the fence

You might ask: Why give Trump the attention? There were plenty of NABJ members unhappy to see Trump offered
a spot on their stage.

But journalists should show people exactly how candidates for public office speak and act, especially if – like Trump
– they lack the discipline and integrity to listen to honest questions and then provide forthright answers.

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 4
                Trump's racism at NABJ was revolting. It was all calculated for his MAGA fan base.

Link to Image

Give Trump every platform he dares to agree to. Ask him to explain himself. Let everyone watch as he fulminates
and prevaricates. Then fact-check him. And then fact-check him some more. And then some more.

His supporters won’t care. They’ll call him a victim. His detractors won’t be surprised. They already know he has
zero integrity.

But undecided voters should see it all. Every blemish. Every bit of empty bombast. Every tantrum. Every time.

Trump hides from tough questions: When is Trump's 'big boy press conference'? His campaign deflected when I
asked.

We can expect to see more of Trump the way we saw him on Wednesday

Consider Trump being asked at NABJ why his party dismisses Harris a “DEI candidate.” He asked for a definition of
DEI, which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion.

The panel explained it to him. He then asked again for a definition of DEI. He was impervious to the information.

Let people see that. Let voters know Trump can't handle the campaign trail unless the conditions are set exactly to
his liking. Let them know the guy who wants to be president melts down if things don't go his way.

The Republican National Committee on Wednesday, in an email to journalists, accused Harris of engaging in a
“media blackout” because she hasn’t held a news conference after being a candidate for president for a week and a
half. The RNC didn’t note that Trump hasn’t held one in more than 20 months.

Wednesday's stops in Chicago and Harrisburg show us why Trump can’t face that. He couldn’t last five minutes.
He'd lose it. On camera. For all to see.

Looking for something to do in New York? Check out the array of festivals on offer, including four days of improv
comedy and three days of improv jazz.

Comedy

 Fun & Dumb Improv Festival

 July 11-14 at various locations in Brooklyn; brooklyncc.com.

 Now in its third year, the Brooklyn Comedy Collective's biggest bash has grown even bigger, with more than 600
improv comedians performing in over 160 shows, as well as a dozen-plus workshops, at the B.C.C.'s performance
spaces in Williamsburg: Eris (167 Graham Avenue), B.C.C. Pig Pen (144 Boerum Street) and B.C.C. Dog House
(137 Montrose Avenue).

  On Thursday at 8 p.m. at Eris, fans of ''Saturday Night Live'' can watch ''Chloe Troast and Coworkers'' on the

 Music

 Sounds of Detroit: Celebrating 50 Years of J Dilla

 July 12 at 6 p.m. at Herbert Von King Park, 670 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn; cityparksfoundation.org.

 By the time J Dilla, born James Yancey, died in 2006 at the age of 32, he had subtly rewired hip-hop. In his short
but prolific career as a producer, he sourced and harvested deep-cut samples and collaged them into rich, smudgy
and soulful beats sought after by the likes of Common, A Tribe Called Quest and Busta Rhymes.

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4
                                             Feel-Good Options All Over

 Yancey would have turned 50 this year. To mark the occasion, SummerStage is hosting a tribute concert on
Friday with a lineup steeped in Dilla lore. It includes Slum Village, the trio of high school friends he first performed
with in his native Detroit (now a duo of one surviving original member, T3, and the rapper and producer Young RJ);
and the Pharcyde, the Los Angeles group whose 1995 hit ''Runnin''' is exemplary of Dilla's production style. The
D.J.s Rich Medina and Breakbeat Lou will also perform.

 Admission is free. OLIVIA HORN

 Wide Open Works Festival

 July 11-13 at Shapeshifter Labs, 837 Union Street, Brooklyn; connectionworks.org/events.

  Since 2022 the nonprofit organization Connection Works has staked out the middle of July for Brooklyn jazz with
its Wide Open Works Festival, which gathers musicians from the borough whose ethos are aligned with the
festival's title: These improvisers and composers aren't just open to surprise connections, they live for them.

  Exemplifying this genre-agnostic spirit is Anna Webber Triangles, which features the bassist Chris Tordini, the
percussionist Ches Smith and the saxophonist Webber, whose compositions spin dizzying geometries. This all-star
indie trio will take the stage on Friday at 8:15 p.m. followed at 9:30 p.m. by the Dead Composers Club, a quartet led
by Noah Preminger on tenor saxophone and Rob Garcia on drums that is currently exploring the 12th-century
music of Hildegard von Bingen. On Saturday, the drummer Ra Kalam Bob Moses will lead two sets, first in a duo
and then a quintet. Day passes are $35; two- and three-day passes are $60 and $80. All are available on
Shapeshifter's website.

 On Friday and Saturday at Ibeam Brooklyn in Gowanus, which once hosted the Wide Open festival, another
midsummer music celebration emphasizing improvisation will take up residence: the first Brooklyn Free Spirit
Festival. Admission to each day's events is $20. ALAN SCHERSTUHL

 Kids

 West Side Fest

 July 12-14 at various locations in Manhattan; westsidefest.nyc.

  Families who normally flee the city on summer weekends may want to make an exception for this one: New York
is offering multiple festivals, all of them free.

 For three days, the West Side Cultural Network, a consortium of downtown Manhattan museums and parks, will
present West Side Fest. The fun begins with the Whitney Museum of American Art's Open Studio for Teens on
Friday. The fest also encompasses the Free Second Sundays program at the Whitney, which includes activities like
making art inspired by the children's literature in the exhibition ''Wanda Gág's World.''

 The High Line is participating as well, with Family Art Moment: Dream Wilder With Us on Saturday. The Rubin
Museum of Art's Family Sunday invites young fest-goers to make Buddhist-influenced 3-D mazes. Little Island will
host Creative Breaks, with a watercolor adventure on Friday and a Haitian cultural celebration on Saturday. (Details
and many more events are on the fest's website.)

 Also in Manhattan, children can enjoy the National Museum of Mathematics's NYC Math Festival on Saturday, and
L'Alliance New York's Bastille Day on Sunday.

 And all five boroughs will have activities for City of Water Day, a Saturday festival devoted to aquatic life and
conservation. LAUREL GRAEBER

 Dance

 Aakash Odedra Company

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 4
                                            Feel-Good Options All Over

  July 11-12 at 7:30 p.m. at the Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 10 Columbus Circle, Manhattan;
lincolncenter.org.

 Since founding his troupe in 2011, the South Asian-British choreographer and dancer Aakash Odedra has
garnered acclaim for captivating works that blend classical Indian and contemporary dance with theatrical flair. His
company comes to New York as part of India Week at Lincoln Center's Summer for the City series.

 Odedra's contribution is his performance with Hu Shenyuan of his piece ''Samsara,'' a duet inspired by the classic
Chinese novel ''Journey to the West.'' The work explores Buddhist philosophy and self-enlightenment through
strikingly lush physical vocabulary and visual design. The shows at the Rose Theater are nearly sold out, but
additional tickets may become available online and in person at the box office ahead of the shows.

 At the end of the month, Summer for the City also presents Urban Bush Women's ''Haint Blu'' (July 28 and Aug. 4)
and the annual BAAND Together Festival, featuring a superstar lineup of Ballet Hispánico, Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater, American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem (July 30-Aug. 3).

A ripple of energy has gone through young voters eager to have the chance to help make Kamala Harris the first
female president in U.S. history, not to mention the first Black woman president and the first South Asian president.

Some have even compared it to how Millennial voters felt with Barack Obama in 2008. Angela Demas, 21, of East
Lansing, Mich. said she remembers hearing about that excitement as a child.

"I could definitely see a lot of people were enthusiastic and ready for change," Demas, who in 2024 is running for
local office, said. "I think that has resurfaced again as Kamala Harris is running."

The connections between Harris and Obama appeared immediately on social media once President Joe Biden on
Sunday said he'd stand down from his own re-election campaign and instead would endorse his vice president in
the White House race against Republican Donald Trump. Memes were shared hundreds of thousands of times.
People remixed her old speeches, her laugh and her dance moves.

Harris' campaign has also embraced it, albeit carefully.

It is too soon to say whether the excitement around Harris translates from social media to votes in November. But
early indicators show she is invigorating a group of Americans who earlier this year were cold to the Democratic
administration's re-election prospects due to a long list of grievances, including concerns over climate change,
inflation and Israel's war in Gaza. Many had previously told USA TODAY they were largely weighing either not
voting or were drifting toward the Republican ticket, which now includes the 78-year-old Trump and the 39-year-old
JD Vance.

"All they've known is Trump or Biden," Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., currently the youngest member of Congress at
27, told USA TODAY. "A lot of them weren't born during Obama and a lot of them were too young, they don't
remember. So 100 percent, for a lot of them it's the first time they felt hope at that level."

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was also the youngest member of Congress when she was elected,
recalled in an interview how she was a teenager when the 47-year-old Obama won the White House in 2008.

                                                                                                            Page 2 of 5

"I totally can see how some people feel similarly, and how this is a similar watershed moment. Not just the fact that
we are really talking about the possibility of the first female to be elected president of the United States, no less a
woman of color and no less a black woman, no less Indian, Caribbean descent as well," she said. "It's very exciting
and invigorating for a lot of people."

Turning that excitement into votes will be key, said Hans Riemer, who was Obama's national youth vote director in
the 2008 general election campaign against John McCain, then a 72-year-old Republican senator from Arizona.
Young voters have become a pivotal voting block, he said.

"Joe Biden's inability to close the deal with young voters contributed to his position in the election, and Harris has
the potential to generate a lot of interest there, and it could be a critical part of her majority," Riemer said. "Trump
was doing much better with young voters and with voters of color than a Republican candidate has in a long time,
and in a lot of polling that is the difference between Trump's victory margin, or at least a lot of it. So if Kamala can
hold the Biden voters and pull in young voters, voters of color who has drifted to Trump, she'll win."

For Obama, it all happened organically. The first generation of the iPhone came out in the summer of 2007, right in
the middle of an intense Democratic primary battle that included Hillary Clinton and Biden. Social media sites like
Facebook and Twitter were still relatively new and gaining in popularity. Young voters trusted that they could
change the outcome of the election by voting for him.

"That was the core," Riemer said. "They believed in their power. Barack Obama believed in them, and told them
that over and over again, and they responded. And you need to have that kind of environment for young voters to
feel like to build that social movement, frankly, a sense of empowerment, impact and a candidate who believes in
it."

Harris has an existing community of online supporters left over from her 2019 bid for president, called the KHive.

The Trump campaign has made a heavy pitch for younger voters this cycle too, and some polls have shown the
effort paying off. A March poll from the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics said that while Biden led
among young voters, Trump's were more enthusiastic about voting for him.

"Polling shows President Trump crushing Kamala Harris with young voters," Trump campaign spokesman Steven
Cheung said. He did not point to a specific poll.

Early indicators

There are some very early indicators a shift is underway.

Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of NextGen America, said Harris has often polled “very high” with young
voters, even when Biden’s approval wasn’t as strong with the same generational demographic.

But after the excitement that the vice president has already garnered, especially with online viral memes, Tzintzún
Ramirez said she would “put all my savings” on the fact that Harris will score high with young voters.

“This is the most diverse generation in American history, so I think a lot of young people see their story in her story,”
she said. “We expect that this will really increase motivation for young people to turn out this election, and also
voters of color.”

Vote.org, a non-partisan voter registration organization, announced Wednesday there was a nearly 700%
increase in daily voter registrations — more than 38,500 new registrations — in the 48-hour period following Biden's
announcement.

Voters aged between 18 and 34 accounted for 83% of new registrations.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said people recognize a chance to vote for hope, just like he did in 2008.

"Many young people were just demoralized about what their future held and now they see a candidate I think that is
connected to them," said Swalwell, a 43-year-old congressman who ran against both Biden and Harris in the 2020
Democratic presidential primaries.

Harris has spoken on 12 college campus' since the Supreme Court ended abortion protections provided under Roe
v. Wade. She was already becoming a familiar face to younger voters, Swalwell said.

"She's not new to this. She's not like Johnny come lately with young people. She's been pretty dialed into what they
care about," he said.

Voter voices

Taino Moreno, 17, was at a donor event for Dave Min, a member of the California State Senate, when he heard the
news that Biden dropped out of the election.

He will be attending Harris’ alma mater, Howard University in the fall.

“I grew up with a Black president, and I was excited,” Moreno said. “I felt like I could do that too...I haven't had a
feeling like that since I was a little boy.

Briana Lee, 18, an incoming freshman at UC Berkeley who lives in Huntington Beach, California, was 2-years-old
when Barack Obama was elected president.

“Young people have experienced the most political apathy in terms of not wanting to vote and because we saw
Trump and Biden go against each other in 2020, I know a lot of people said they didn't want that rematch," Lee
said. "I think it has a lot of potential to reinvigorate the youth voter base."

Justyn Kelly, 21, studying political economy at the USC, from LA, voted in the 2022 midterms, but this is the first
time he's been able to vote for president.

“I'm very excited to vote for somebody who will be – and will be, I'm going to put that out there – the first female
president of the United States.”

Vice President Kamala Harris faces many questions, from the management of her campaign to the selection of her
running mate, should she be the Democratic Party’s nominee.

President Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the presidential ticket after ending his re-election
campaign on Sunday, raising the chance that she could be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian
descent to be president of the United States.

Ms. Harris in many ways has been preparing for this moment for the past year as she emerged as one of the Biden
campaign’s more aggressive voices on abortion rights and attacks on former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Biden
spoke to Ms. Harris on Sunday morning before he posted a letter online informing the world that he would be
stepping down as the Democratic nominee.

In another post less than a half-hour later, he endorsed Ms. Harris, who quickly issued a statement saying she
intended to “earn and win this nomination.”

But as the details of the nominating process remain unclear, there are many questions Ms. Harris and her team will
face in the days ahead.

What About Her Campaign?

Ms. Harris will now need to take over the vast infrastructure of Mr. Biden’s campaign, which has roughly 1,300 staff
members and dozens of offices around the nation. There are signs that is already happening.

On a call with the Biden campaign staff on Sunday, Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chairwoman, and Julie
Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager, informed the staff members that they were all now working for
Harris for President, according to two people who listened to the call. “We’re all going to do it the same,” Ms.
Chavez Rodriguez said.

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4
                                        What’s Next for the Harris Campaign

Ms. Harris already has connections to Ms. Chavez Rodriguez, who served as Ms. Harris’s state director when she
was in the Senate. Ms. Chavez Rodriguez later worked on her unsuccessful 2020 campaign for president.

The vice president has ramped up her own campaign team in the past year — although they maintained it was just
to support her as Mr. Biden’s No. 2. Her advisers for her vice-presidential campaign team include Brian Fallon, the
communications director, who also worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, and Sheila Nix, the chief of staff,
who held the same position in Jill Biden’s office when Mr. Biden was vice president.

If Ms. Harris is the nominee, who will be her vice-presidential pick?

Well aware of the cold reality of identity politics, Democrats assume that if Ms. Harris, the first Black and Asian
American woman to be vice president, were nominated to the presidency, she would most likely balance her ticket
with a white man.

One emerging favorite is Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Southern moderate who works with a Republican
legislature and has joined Ms. Harris in attacking Republicans over abortion rights restrictions. Ms. Harris got to
know Mr. Cooper when they were both attorneys general of their states. The vice president traveled to North
Carolina on Thursday to hold a campaign rally with Mr. Cooper.

Another candidate mentioned is Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, who won a second term in a conservative state
last year. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania could theoretically help Democrats capture a swing state battleground
critical to victory in November. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a billionaire who could provide substantial financing for
the campaign, is another possibility. Democrats have also floated Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona and a
former astronaut known as a pragmatist representing a border state.

Mr. Kelly endorsed Ms. Harris on Sunday.

If Ms. Harris wants to make history and roll the dice, she could select Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, which
would test whether America is ready for two women in the White House.

Whom does she rely on?

After a series of stilted appearances when the new vice president showed little command of policy, Ms. Harris
shook up her team of senior aides and in 2022 brought veteran political operatives into her inner circle.

Ms. Harris elevated Lorraine Voles, who served as director of communications for Vice President Al Gore, to be her
chief of staff. Ms. Voles, a crisis communications expert, had previously advised Ms. Harris on communications and
had worked on the presidential campaigns of Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Walter Mondale in 1984.

Ms. Harris has also promoted Kirsten Allen, who worked on Ms. Harris’s short-lived 2020 presidential campaign,
from press secretary to communications director. Stephanie Young joined Ms. Harris’s staff last year as a senior
adviser focused on outreach and messaging from her role working with a voting rights organization founded by
Michelle Obama.

Ms. Harris has also worked closely with Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House chief of staff.

Ms. Harris has relied on Democratic operatives, donors and lawmakers she has worked with in her previous roles
for advice. They have counseled her to lean into her own voice and appeal to reach crucial voting blocs, including
business leaders and Black men.

What about the money and delegates?

Mr. Biden made clear on Sunday that Ms. Harris would take control of at least part of his campaign apparatus when
he posted a link to what was his “Biden-Harris” donation page. Now it states in bold letters: “Donate to Elect Kamala
Harris.”

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 4
                                        What’s Next for the Harris Campaign

Ms. Harris will most likely have no interruption in taking control of the $96 million the Biden-Harris campaign held as
of June 30. The money is held in the campaign accounts, and therefore Ms. Harris would be able to use it to face
Mr. Trump in November. This has been the thrust of her support from donors, who have rallied behind her in recent
weeks.

Mr. Biden also gave Ms. Harris an advantage by endorsing her. But while the endorsement will provide some
influence on the Democratic convention delegates, Ms. Harris does not automatically receive their votes and Mr.
Biden cannot force them to follow his lead. They are essentially free agents, able to vote for any candidate of their
choosing.

Will the Democrats support her?

Ms. Harris drew endorsements from a range of influential Democrats on Sunday, including former President Bill
Clinton, Hillary Clinton and the Congressional Black Caucus.

But there are still other prominent Democrats, such as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker,
who said before Sunday that they would favor an open-primary contest, in which Ms. Harris would compete with
other potential nominees. It is unclear whether Ms. Pelosi will continue to favor such a contest, and whether any
potential candidates will be willing to challenge Ms. Harris and create more uncertainty in the party.

Notably, in a statement issued on Sunday after Mr. Biden’s decision to drop out, former President Barack Obama
did not endorse Ms. Harris. “We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,” Mr. Obama said. “But I
have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an
outstanding nominee emerges.”

A person familiar with Mr. Obama’s thinking said later on Sunday that the former president was following the same
policy of neutrality he adopted during the 2020 Democratic primaries, when Mr. Biden faced a field of competitors,
and wanted to help unite the party once there was an official nominee.

But Representative Robert Garcia, Democrat of California, said in an interview that there would not be an open
convention and that the Democratic Party would unite around Ms. Harris. He was a co-chairman for Ms. Harris’s
2020 campaign, and she swore him in as mayor of Long Beach, Calif.

“It’s not happening,” Mr. Garcia said. “There will be no open convention. A lot of folks are going to take their cues
from the president.”

Ms. Harris also received the endorsement of Representative James E. Clyburn, an influential South Carolina
Democrat who helped revive Mr. Biden’s campaign in 2020.

“I echo the good judgment he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him,”
Mr. Clyburn said in a statement, “and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as
the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for president.”

Ms. Harris wasted no time in building support for her candidacy on Sunday. She called Representative Steven
Horsford, Democrat of Nevada and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and said she would “run and
earn it and win it,” according to a congressional official familiar with the discussion.

Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement saying that the next steps
on the nomination process would be coming “in short order.”

“The work that we must do now, while unprecedented, is clear,” Mr. Harrison said. “In the coming days, the party
will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate
who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”
