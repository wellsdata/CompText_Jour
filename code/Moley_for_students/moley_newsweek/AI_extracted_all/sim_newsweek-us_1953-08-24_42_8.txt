**Rediscovering Congress**

by Raymond Moley

SANTA BARBARA, CALIF.â€”The history of these times may well record that in this momentous year there was seen a very significant constitutional change in the United States. That change, a matter of custom rather than of formal amendment, has been the re-establishment of Congress as a coequal with the Executive in our Federal government.

We have been told that this is an Eisenhower Congress. That is not true. It is Congress's Congress. It is the American electorate's Congress. And, as I shall presently show, the President himself would warmly agree with that statement.

The score of this Congress has been good. Its zeal for economy has materially outstripped that of the Administration. Excluding permanent appropriations, the Truman requests were $64,115,000,000. The President cut this by $10,000,000,000. The House cut $4,000,000,000 more. The Senate then added $1,000,000,000. The final figure: $51,017,000,000. This is the Congress that used to be excoriated as spendthrift. This is the House of Representatives Alexander Hamilton expected would be a body moved by passion and radicalism.

The Congress with the President moved to terminate the long cold war with private business. It passed extensive reorganization plans and provided for two very important commissions, one of them headed by Herbert Hoover and charged with recommending still more sweeping reorganizations and economies. Congress responded to the President's request for the extension of the excess-profits tax despite the grave doubts of many who voted for it. The wise refusal to raise the debt limit was not a rebuff to the President who had left the question open. All this was the result of the joint action of equals in a friendly atmosphere of mutual respect.

The advent of this revolution in constitutional custom has not escaped the attention of "liberal" commentators and leftist politicians. They are making a great fuss about the need for a "strong" Executive. Through its "democratic digest," the Democratic National Committee makes the absurd charge that Congress is trying to establish "iron control."

Considering the slim Republican majority any such usurpation would need Democratic votes. Do the authors believe that they can hoodwink those Southern members who for years have found their Congress and not their Presidents the real friend and protector of the sovereignty of their states and the liberties of their people?

This is no partisan matter. It was a Republican President, Theodore Roosevelt, who initiated the custom of beating the brains out of Congress. Wilson continued that tradition until Congress rebelled. F.D.R. vigorously revived the practice and his successor, after failing to dominate, descended to reckless abuse.

Credit for the current reversal of the trend must go in equal shares to the President and Robert A. Taft. Together they established a wholesome balance in government, a balance in line with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.

There is nothing that suggests expediency or half-heartedness about this Eisenhower philosophy of co-equality. His respect for constitutional status of Congress has been repeatedly emphasized in words and in actions. In a recent luncheon speech to members of Congress he said:  "I have read a lot about this picture of a leader who sticks out his jaw, pounds the table, and demands. Now after all, if you get a good idea why can't you lead it out and put it in front of people to investigate, to turn it over? Whether it is popular or unpopular if it's a sound idea it's adopted by the American people which means by the American Congress."

HE ILLUSTRATED his point by the concept of leadership held by Gen. George Patton, himself a great leader of men. Patton said that when you want to get spaghetti across a table you don't push it, you pull it. We shall have less driving and more leading by the Executive in these next years. And we shall have a Congress respected and trusted because it is master in its own domain.
