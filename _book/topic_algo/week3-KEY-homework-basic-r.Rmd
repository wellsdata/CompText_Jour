# Loading and Analyzing Data Exercise

This class exercise is a companion to the following chapter in Computational Text Analysis: [Ch. 11  Loading and Analyzing Data](https://wellsdata.github.io/CompText_Jour/docs/r-load-analyze-visualize.html)


#1: load tidyverse, rio and janitor libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```


#2: Import Data:

https://github.com/wellsdata/CompText_Jour/raw/main/data/mob_analysis_data.csv
```{r}

mob <- read.csv("https://github.com/wellsdata/CompText_Jour/raw/main/data/mob_analysis_data.csv")

```

#3: Provide dimensions: Gives number rows, then columns

```{r}
```

#4: Show names of your columns

```{r}

```

#5: Check data types

```{r}

```

#6: Display the first six rows

```{r}

```


#7: Create a table counting the number of entries by year and display the top 5 results

```{r}

mob %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = count, n = 5)


```

#8: Create a table that counts the different entries in the "keyword" column

```{r}

mob %>% 
  group_by(keyword) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

```


Create a simple column ggplot chart that shows the total entries by year

```{r}

mob %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  count(Year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
#This is your title sequence
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Day, San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 2-12-2022",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Year")


```
