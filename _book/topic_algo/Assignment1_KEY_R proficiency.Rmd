#1: --Load relevant software libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(janitor)
```

#2: Load the data: https://github.com/wellsdata/CompText_Jour/raw/main/data/blackindex_master.csv
```{r}

test <- rio::import("https://github.com/wellsdata/CompText_Jour/raw/main/data/blackindex_master.csv") 

```

#3: Using code, describe the number of rows and columns in the dataset

```{r}
dim(test)


# in this data set there are 1803 rows and 30 columns.. 


# Here's how Sean did it
print(paste0("This dataset has ", nrow(test), " rows and ", ncol(test), " columns. Each row in this dataset appears to describe a single article that appeared in a Black newspaper between ", min(test$year), " and ", max(test$year), ". The articles appear to have been sourced from several historical newspaper databases and archives. Many of the article headlines reference racial terror lynching."))

```

#4: Create a table that displays a count of the top 5 newspaper_city entries
```{r}
test %>% 
  count(newspaper_city) %>% 
 slice_max(order_by = n, n = 5)

```

#5: Create a table that counts all newspaper_city entries by year. UPDATE: Filter out the NA values
```{r}
#entries_year <- test %>% 
test %>% 
  filter(!is.na(newspaper_city)) %>% 
  count(newspaper_city, year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 
  


```


#6: --Create a simple column ggplot chart that shows the total entries by year
```{r}
ggplot(entries_year, aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Years of Lynching Coverage",
       caption = "By Rob Wells",
       y="Articles",
       x="Year")


#Second option
test %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
count(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n, fill=n))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
labs(title = "Years of Lynching Coverage",
       caption = "By Rob Wells")

#thire option
test %>%
  count(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Total Articles by Year in Black Index Master",
       subtitle = "There are more articles from 1920 in this dataset than any other year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Articles",
       caption = "Source: Black Index Master Dataset, Via Prof. Rob Wells") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1850, 2020, 10)) +
  #rotate x axis labels 45 degrees
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```


# Extra items for discussion in class

```{r}

test %>% 
  filter(newspaper_city == c("Chicago", "Pittsburgh", "Atlanta")) %>% 
  count(newspaper_city, year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 

```
#Filter out a city
```{r}

test %>% 
  filter(newspaper_city != "Chicago") %>% 
  count(newspaper_city, year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 

```

--Create a table that counts all newspaper_city entries by year
```{r}

entries_year <- test %>% 
  filter(!is.na(newspaper_city)) %>% 
  select(year, newspaper_city) %>% 
  group_by(year, newspaper_city) %>% 
  count(year) 

```
