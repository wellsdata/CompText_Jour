Vice President Kamala Harris faces many questions, from the management of her campaign to the selection of her
running mate, should she be the Democratic Party’s nominee.

President Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the presidential ticket after ending his re-election
campaign on Sunday, raising the chance that she could be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian
descent to be president of the United States.

Ms. Harris in many ways has been preparing for this moment for the past year as she emerged as one of the Biden
campaign’s more aggressive voices on abortion rights and attacks on former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Biden
spoke to Ms. Harris on Sunday morning before he posted a letter online informing the world that he would be
stepping down as the Democratic nominee.

In another post less than a half-hour later, he endorsed Ms. Harris, who quickly issued a statement saying she
intended to “earn and win this nomination.”

But as the details of the nominating process remain unclear, there are many questions Ms. Harris and her team will
face in the days ahead.

What About Her Campaign?

Ms. Harris will now need to take over the vast infrastructure of Mr. Biden’s campaign, which has roughly 1,300 staff
members and dozens of offices around the nation. There are signs that is already happening.

On a call with the Biden campaign staff on Sunday, Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chairwoman, and Julie
Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager, informed the staff members that they were all now working for
Harris for President, according to two people who listened to the call. “We’re all going to do it the same,” Ms.
Chavez Rodriguez said.

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4
                                        What’s Next for the Harris Campaign

Ms. Harris already has connections to Ms. Chavez Rodriguez, who served as Ms. Harris’s state director when she
was in the Senate. Ms. Chavez Rodriguez later worked on her unsuccessful 2020 campaign for president.

The vice president has ramped up her own campaign team in the past year — although they maintained it was just
to support her as Mr. Biden’s No. 2. Her advisers for her vice-presidential campaign team include Brian Fallon, the
communications director, who also worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, and Sheila Nix, the chief of staff,
who held the same position in Jill Biden’s office when Mr. Biden was vice president.

If Ms. Harris is the nominee, who will be her vice-presidential pick?

Well aware of the cold reality of identity politics, Democrats assume that if Ms. Harris, the first Black and Asian
American woman to be vice president, were nominated to the presidency, she would most likely balance her ticket
with a white man.

One emerging favorite is Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Southern moderate who works with a Republican
legislature and has joined Ms. Harris in attacking Republicans over abortion rights restrictions. Ms. Harris got to
know Mr. Cooper when they were both attorneys general of their states. The vice president traveled to North
Carolina on Thursday to hold a campaign rally with Mr. Cooper.

Another candidate mentioned is Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, who won a second term in a conservative state
last year. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania could theoretically help Democrats capture a swing state battleground
critical to victory in November. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a billionaire who could provide substantial financing for
the campaign, is another possibility. Democrats have also floated Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona and a
former astronaut known as a pragmatist representing a border state.

Mr. Kelly endorsed Ms. Harris on Sunday.

If Ms. Harris wants to make history and roll the dice, she could select Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, which
would test whether America is ready for two women in the White House.

Whom does she rely on?

After a series of stilted appearances when the new vice president showed little command of policy, Ms. Harris
shook up her team of senior aides and in 2022 brought veteran political operatives into her inner circle.

Ms. Harris elevated Lorraine Voles, who served as director of communications for Vice President Al Gore, to be her
chief of staff. Ms. Voles, a crisis communications expert, had previously advised Ms. Harris on communications and
had worked on the presidential campaigns of Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Walter Mondale in 1984.

Ms. Harris has also promoted Kirsten Allen, who worked on Ms. Harris’s short-lived 2020 presidential campaign,
from press secretary to communications director. Stephanie Young joined Ms. Harris’s staff last year as a senior
adviser focused on outreach and messaging from her role working with a voting rights organization founded by
Michelle Obama.

Ms. Harris has also worked closely with Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House chief of staff.

Ms. Harris has relied on Democratic operatives, donors and lawmakers she has worked with in her previous roles
for advice. They have counseled her to lean into her own voice and appeal to reach crucial voting blocs, including
business leaders and Black men.

What about the money and delegates?

Mr. Biden made clear on Sunday that Ms. Harris would take control of at least part of his campaign apparatus when
he posted a link to what was his “Biden-Harris” donation page. Now it states in bold letters: “Donate to Elect Kamala
Harris.”

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 4
                                        What’s Next for the Harris Campaign

Ms. Harris will most likely have no interruption in taking control of the $96 million the Biden-Harris campaign held as
of June 30. The money is held in the campaign accounts, and therefore Ms. Harris would be able to use it to face
Mr. Trump in November. This has been the thrust of her support from donors, who have rallied behind her in recent
weeks.

Mr. Biden also gave Ms. Harris an advantage by endorsing her. But while the endorsement will provide some
influence on the Democratic convention delegates, Ms. Harris does not automatically receive their votes and Mr.
Biden cannot force them to follow his lead. They are essentially free agents, able to vote for any candidate of their
choosing.

Will the Democrats support her?

Ms. Harris drew endorsements from a range of influential Democrats on Sunday, including former President Bill
Clinton, Hillary Clinton and the Congressional Black Caucus.

But there are still other prominent Democrats, such as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker,
who said before Sunday that they would favor an open-primary contest, in which Ms. Harris would compete with
other potential nominees. It is unclear whether Ms. Pelosi will continue to favor such a contest, and whether any
potential candidates will be willing to challenge Ms. Harris and create more uncertainty in the party.

Notably, in a statement issued on Sunday after Mr. Biden’s decision to drop out, former President Barack Obama
did not endorse Ms. Harris. “We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,” Mr. Obama said. “But I
have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an
outstanding nominee emerges.”

A person familiar with Mr. Obama’s thinking said later on Sunday that the former president was following the same
policy of neutrality he adopted during the 2020 Democratic primaries, when Mr. Biden faced a field of competitors,
and wanted to help unite the party once there was an official nominee.

But Representative Robert Garcia, Democrat of California, said in an interview that there would not be an open
convention and that the Democratic Party would unite around Ms. Harris. He was a co-chairman for Ms. Harris’s
2020 campaign, and she swore him in as mayor of Long Beach, Calif.

“It’s not happening,” Mr. Garcia said. “There will be no open convention. A lot of folks are going to take their cues
from the president.”

Ms. Harris also received the endorsement of Representative James E. Clyburn, an influential South Carolina
Democrat who helped revive Mr. Biden’s campaign in 2020.

“I echo the good judgment he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him,”
Mr. Clyburn said in a statement, “and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as
the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for president.”

Ms. Harris wasted no time in building support for her candidacy on Sunday. She called Representative Steven
Horsford, Democrat of Nevada and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and said she would “run and
earn it and win it,” according to a congressional official familiar with the discussion.

Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement saying that the next steps
on the nomination process would be coming “in short order.”

“The work that we must do now, while unprecedented, is clear,” Mr. Harrison said. “In the coming days, the party
will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate
who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”
