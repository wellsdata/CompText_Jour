Oh! Calcutta opens in Long Island City; Grand Brasserie fills Vanderbilt Hall with Parisian flair and more restaurant
news.

Opening

 Oh! Calcutta

 The louche collection of sketches by the critic Kenneth Tynan that opened Off Broadway in 1969 has inspired the
name of this new restaurant in Queens. Ruhel Amin, who has Indian restaurants in Harlem and Williamsburg,
presents dishes from Kolkata, including a Lake Market fish fry, vegetable cutlet, chapli kebab with minced lamb, and
kosha mangsho, a goat curry here. Workhorses like butter chicken, rogan josh and saag paneer are also on the
menu. The chefs are Sharmeen Rahman and Lisha Khondoka; both women have worked in Mr. Amin's other
restaurants.

 10-57 Jackson Avenue (50th Avenue), Long Island City, Queens, 718-532-0017, ohcalcuttanyc.com.

 Grand Brasserie

  Rick Blatstein, having sold OTG, his airport restaurant company with hundreds of outlets, continues to think big.
His new company, Vizz Group, has taken over the landmark Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal, previously
run by City Winery, and the adjacent dining room, formerly Cornelius. Grand Brasserie is an airy 400-seat
restaurant and bar, open during the terminal's hours. The Rockwell Group's design with Art Deco and Beaux Arts
accents and splashes of scarlet on tabletops and seats reflect the style of many Parisian brasseries and railway
terminals. (Opens Sunday)

 89 East 42nd Street.

 Tziki

 Souvlaki and gyro are the featured players in this Greek spot with counter service from the restaurateur Harry
Nicolaou and the chef Alexandros Gkoutsi. Pork, beef, chicken and mushroom are the options sliced from
pirouetting spits or strung on skewers. Homemade sourdough pita are underpinnings or wraps. The space has been

 Mr. Bao

  An uncommon specialty has come to the heart of Midtown: abalone. Empress International, a South African food
company with a location in Old Tappan, N.J., imports the shellfish from South Africa. It has opened a duplex
restaurant, where the entire menu is devoted to abalone, often in Asian preparations. The mollusks are farm-raised
in an area just south of Cape Town. Abalone spring rolls, dumplings, skewers, stir-fried with Wagyu, fried rice, in
tom yum soup and cucumber salad ($9.95 to $39.99, with a 25 percent opening discount until the end of this month)
are some of the options. The company also plans restaurants in Chinatown and Long Island City, Queens. It's not
connected to the Mr. Bao chain of fast casual spots.

 110 West 40th Street, 929-302-3551, mrbaous.com.

 Joo OK

 A freight elevator whisks guests to the 16th floor of the building where the setting replicates a traditional Korean
home or hanok. Original industrial elements share the space with Korean art. The chef, Chang ho Shim, is opening
his New York restaurant for the prolific Hand Hospitality restaurant group. He seeks local ingredients for an upscale
menu in the works, which could include items like shrimp and vegetables with pine nut sauce, mollusks and pickled
quail egg with homemade perilla oil, and seafood with smoked soy sauce. (Tuesday, Sept. 3)

 22 West 32nd Street No. 16, 646-410-0332, joo-ok.com.

 Comida Corrida

  A plate of esquites or ceviche to temper the tequila perhaps? Now all it takes it heading upstairs from the bar, Only
Love Strangers, for home-style Mexican fare by the chef Alberto Gomez. The restaurant is a Mexican detour from
the Málà Project group, and its name refers to a Mexican set menu, here for $24 in addition to à la carte options.

 Japanese Listening Room & Speakeasy

  The second floor of the cavernous Zuma restaurant in Midtown has been turned into a reservations-only bar for
drinks like a cherry blossom gimlet and a fig leaf highball all featuring Suntory whiskies. Part of the space is a
Tokyo-style immersive listening room, also to reserve, with vinyl transmitted in high fidelity. The bar will also have a
top-flight audio system.

 261 Madison Avenue (38th Street), 212-544-9862, zumarestaurant.com.

 Branches

 Crave Fishbar

 The reliable seafood restaurants in Midtown East and the Upper West Side that rely mostly on local waters as their
sources has added the Upper East Side to its lineup.

 1462 Second Avenue (76th Street), 212-688-8888, cravefishbar.com.

 Myra Alperson, who led food-themed walking tours throughout the city but was stopped in her tracks with the
pandemic, has organized a new one in the Bronx. It was requested by Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice, a
Soundview-Bronx River neighborhood group. Tastes of Mexico, Ecuador, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Guyana,
Puerto Rico, Peru and West Africa for sampling and purchase reflect the diversity of the area.

 On the Menu

 Zero Acre Farms

  To my wardrobe of media for frying and sautéing I've just added this new oil. And so have a number of chefs.
Made from fermented South American sugar cane, the oil has a high smoke point (485 degrees Fahrenheit), is
supposed to be less prone to oxidation than seed oils, with more stability so needs changing less often, enhancing
the bottom line. It's over 90 percent monounsaturated fat. It's neutral, quite light and doesn't produce greasy results.
Coqodaq in Manhattan uses it for the rafts of chicken it fries. Swizzler in Washington, D.C., Stoa Bar in San
Francisco and the private club 55 Seventy in Dallas are some other devotees. Its retail price of $29.99 for 16
ounces is not everyday, but it's a credible replacement for cold-pressed grapeseed oil.
